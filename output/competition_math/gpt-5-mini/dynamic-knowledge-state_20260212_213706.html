I know to check continuity at x = 2 and x = -2 by evaluating each relevant piece at those boundaries. I&#x27;m unsure how to set up and solve the equations that enforce continuity at those two points to find a and b, and how those two conditions relate to a+b.

Query: Can you show me how to set up the continuity conditions at x = 2 and x = -2 for this piecewise function, and how those conditions lead to equations involving a and b?</div></div><div class="turn assistant"><div class="role">assistant</div><div class="content">Good — continuity of a piecewise function at the borderpoints means the left and right limits at each border equal the function value there. The borders here are x = 2 and x = −2. Let’s set up the needed equalities step by step; I’ll ask a couple of guiding questions as we go.

1) At x = 2:
- Which piece applies at x = 2 exactly? (Look at the inequalities.)
- What is the value of f(2) from that piece?
- What is the right-hand value (limit as x → 2+) from the piece for x &gt; 2?
- For continuity at 2, what equality must those two values satisfy?

2) At x = −2:
- Which piece applies at x = −2 exactly?
- What is f(−2) from that piece?
- What is the left-hand value (limit as x → −2−) from the piece for x &lt; −2?
- For continuity at −2, what equality must those two values satisfy?

Now fill in the expressions:

- For x = 2: the middle piece (−2 ≤ x ≤ 2) gives f(2) = 2 − 5. The right-piece (x &gt; 2) gives the limit from the right as a·2 + 3. Continuity at 2 requires
  a·2 + 3 = 2 − 5.

- For x = −2: the middle piece (−2 ≤ x ≤ 2) gives f(−2) = (−2) − 5. The left-piece (x &lt; −2) gives the left-hand limit as 2·(−2) − b. Continuity at −2 requires
  2·(−2) − b = (−2) − 5.

Those are the two equations in a and b. Do you want to solve them now to find a and b (and then a + b), or would you like a hint for solving each equation?</div></div><div class="turn user"><div class="role">user</div><div class="content">Thought: I understand how you set up the continuity equalities at x = 2 and x = −2. You showed f(2)=2−5 and the right-hand expression a·2+3, and f(−2)=(−2)−5 with the left expression 2·(−2)−b. I haven&#x27;t actually solved those equations before, so I&#x27;m not sure how to find a and b from them. I might try to add or rearrange them, but I&#x27;m a bit unsure which algebra steps to do next.

Message: Thanks — I see the two equations you wrote:
1) 2a + 3 = 2 − 5
2) 2·(−2) − b = (−2) − 5

I&#x27;m not confident solving these for a and b yet. Could you show the next algebra step for the first equation (solving for a)? After that I can try the second one and tell you what I get.</div></div><div class="turn assistant"><div class="role">assistant</div><div class="content">Sure — let’s solve the first equation step by step.

You have 2a + 3 = 2 − 5. First simplify the right side: 2 − 5 = −3. So the equation becomes
2a + 3 = −3.

Next subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the 2a term:
2a = −3 − 3 = −6.

Finally divide both sides by 2:
a = −6 / 2 = −3.

Now you can try the second equation 2·(−2) − b = (−2) − 5. What do you get for b?</div></div><div class="turn user"><div class="role">user</div><div class="content">Thought: I followed your algebra steps and I see how you isolated a and solved a = −3. I learned subtracting 3 then dividing by 2 gives the value for a. For the second equation I&#x27;m a bit unsure which side to simplify first — I can try simplifying both sides then isolate b. I know I should solve 2·(−2) − b = (−2) − 5 by evaluating the multiplications and sums, then move b to one side.

Message: Okay, I&#x27;ll try the second one now: 2·(−2) − b = (−2) − 5. First I simplify both sides: 2·(−2) = −4, and (−2) − 5 = −7. So the equation becomes −4 − b = −7. Next I want to isolate b — should I add 4 to both sides (giving −b = −7 + 4 = −3) and then multiply both sides by −1 to get b = 3? Is that the correct next step and final value for b?</div></div><div class="turn assistant"><div class="role">assistant</div><div class="content">Yes — your steps are correct.

Starting from −4 − b = −7, adding 4 to both sides gives −b = −3. Multiplying both sides by −1 yields b = 3.

You now have a = −3 and b = 3. If you want, compute a + b next. What do you get?</div></div><div class="turn user"><div class="role">user</div><div class="content">Thought: I followed your steps for both equations and see how continuity at each border gives an equation we can solve. I learned to simplify each side first, then isolate the variable by undoing addition/subtraction and finally division or multiplying by −1. I understand how you found a = −3 and b = 3, but I&#x27;m a little unsure about combining them next.

Message: Okay — I see how you solved for a and b using those continuity equations. To combine them, do I just add the two values together (a + b = −3 + 3)? If so, that gives 0. Is that the final quantity we should report, or is there another step I should consider after finding a + b?</div></div><div class="turn assistant"><div class="role">assistant</div><div class="content">Yes — you just add the values you found: a + b = (−3) + 3 = 0. That&#x27;s the final answer; no further steps are needed. Good work checking each step.</div></div><div class="turn user"><div class="role">user</div><div class="content">Thought: I followed how continuity at the borders gave two equations and watched you solve them. I learned that you set left/right limits equal to the middle piece value at each border to get linear equations for a and b. I understand solving the first equation for a and the second for b, and I see adding them gives 0. I feel confident with continuity setup and the algebra steps, but I want to be sure there&#x27;s no extra interpretation needed after computing a + b.

Message: Thanks — that explanation helped me learn how continuity gives the equations and how to solve them. I understand a = −3 and b = 3, and that a + b = 0 is the final reported value. Is there ever a case where, after finding parameters from continuity, we would need to check anything else (like differentiability or domain restrictions), or is reporting the parameter sum typically sufficient for this kind of question?</div></div><div class="turn assistant"><div class="role">assistant</div><div class="content">Good question — glad you asked.

For this specific problem, asking for a and b (or a + b) under the condition that the piecewise function is continuous, once you ensure the left and right limits equal the function value at each boundary, you’re done. Reporting a + b = 0 is sufficient.

However, in other problems you might need to check additional things depending on what’s asked:

- Differentiability: If the question requires the function to be differentiable at a boundary, you must also set the left and right derivatives equal there and solve those equations (which can give extra constraints or force different parameter values).
- Domain or function-definition issues: Sometimes a point in the interval may not be included in any piece (e.g., open intervals leaving a hole); you then must ensure the function is actually defined there or modify the definition.
- Multiple boundary points: If there are several boundaries, you need to impose continuity at each one (as we did at x = 2 and x = −2).
- Consistency checks: Occasionally the continuity equations can be contradictory (no solution) or underdetermined (infinitely many solutions); you should note that outcome if it occurs.
- Contextual constraints: If parameters are supposed to be integers, positive, etc., you must respect those extra conditions.

So for continuity-only problems like this one, solving the continuity conditions and reporting the requested combination (a + b) is typically sufficient. If the problem asked for differentiability or had extra constraints, you’d need extra steps.</div></div><div class="turn user"><div class="role">user</div><div class="content">Thought: I understand how continuity gave the two equations and how you solved them to find a = −3 and b = 3, and that a + b = 0 is the final value for this continuity-only question. I learned that sometimes extra checks (like differentiability or domain issues) might be required in other problems, which makes sense.

Message: Thanks — that clarifies everything for me. I see why a = −3 and b = 3, and why a + b = 0 is the final answer here. One quick question: if a problem did require differentiability at a boundary, would I always set the left and right derivatives equal at that point (in addition to continuity)?</div></div><div class="turn assistant"><div class="role">assistant</div><div class="content">Yes — if a problem requires differentiability at a boundary point, you must have both continuity and equality of the left and right derivatives at that point. More precisely:

- First ensure continuity at the point: the left-hand limit, the value at the point (if defined), and the right-hand limit must all be equal.
- Then enforce differentiability: the left-hand derivative (limit of the difference quotient from the left) must equal the right-hand derivative (limit from the right).

In practice, for piecewise-defined functions made of simple expressions (polynomials, linear pieces, etc.), that means:

- Compute the derivative formula on each side of the boundary (for x &lt; c and x &gt; c).
- Evaluate each derivative at the boundary point (taking the limit as x → c from the left and right).
- Set those two numbers equal and solve for the parameters, along with the continuity equations.

Example (brief sketch): if you had
f(x) = { ax + 3 for x &gt; 2; x − 5 for x ≤ 2 }
then differentiability at x = 2 would require:
- continuity: a·2 + 3 = 2 − 5 (as we did), and
- derivative equality: derivative on the right is a, derivative on the left is 1, so a = 1.

Note that continuity is necessary for differentiability, but not sufficient: having equal derivatives (and both sides defined) ensures differentiability.

Also be aware of cases where derivatives don&#x27;t exist (cusps, corners, vertical tangents) — then no choice of parameters can make the function differentiable there.</div></div><div class="turn user"><div class="role">user</div><div class="content">Thought: I understand that differentiability requires both continuity and equality of left/right derivatives. That makes sense — first make sure limits match, then set the derivatives equal at the boundary. I see why continuity alone was enough for this problem, and when differentiability would add another equation.

Message: Thanks — that explanation cleared things up. One quick thing I want to check: when computing the left and right derivatives at the boundary, do I always take the derivative formulas for the pieces and then evaluate them at the point (i.e., take limits of the derivative expressions as x → c±), or are there cases where I need to compute the limit of the difference quotient directly instead of just plugging into the derivative expressions?</div></div><div class="turn assistant"><div class="role">assistant</div><div class="content">Good question — the short answer is: usually you can take the derivative formulas for each piece and evaluate their limits at the boundary, but there are situations where you should go back to the difference quotient and compute one- or two-sided limits directly.

Here’s how to decide which approach to use:

1) When it&#x27;s safe to evaluate derivative formulas
- If each piece is differentiable on an open interval that reaches up to (but not across) the boundary point (for example, polynomials, exponentials, trig, etc.), then you can compute the derivative on each piece by ordinary differentiation and evaluate the one-sided derivatives by taking the limit of those derivative expressions as x → c− and x → c+. For linear and polynomial pieces this is automatic and safe.
- In practice most textbook piecewise problems use standard differentiable expressions on each side, so this shortcut works.

2) When you should compute the difference quotient directly
- If the piece is not known to be differentiable at points arbitrarily close to the boundary (e.g., it contains an absolute value, a piece that itself has a corner, or a formula defined only at isolated points), you must use the limit of the difference quotient from the appropriate side:
  lim_{h→0+} [f(c+h) − f(c)]/h for the right-hand derivative,
  lim_{h→0−} [f(c+h) − f(c)]/h for the left-hand derivative.
- If the derivative formula has a removable singularity or involves expressions that are undefined at the boundary but have a limit (for example rational expressions that cancel), directly computing the difference quotient may be necessary to capture cancellation before taking the limit.
- If you suspect the derivative might not exist even though the expressions look differentiable (for instance due to oscillation, or because the function definitions change in a complicated way), use the difference-quotient definition to be sure.

A helpful rule of thumb
- If each side is given by a nice differentiable formula on an interval reaching the boundary, differentiate the piecewise formulas and evaluate at the boundary from the appropriate side.
- If either side is nonstandard, nondifferentiable, or involves potential cancellation/undefined expressions at the boundary, compute the one-sided difference quotients.

Would you like to try a short example where using the derivative formulas works, and one where you must use the difference quotient? I can guide you through either.</div></div><div class="turn user"><div class="role">user</div><div class="content">Thought: I understand that usually you can just evaluate derivative formulas on each side at the boundary if those pieces are nice (polynomial, linear, etc.), and that only in tricky cases (absolute value, removable singularity, oscillation) should I compute the difference quotient directly. I learned when each approach is appropriate, and I can ask about one subtle point I don&#x27;t fully grasp.

Message: Thanks — that clarification helped. One quick thing I&#x27;m unsure about: when evaluating the derivative formulas at the boundary, you said to take the limit of the derivative expressions as x → c±. Is that ever different from simply plugging x = c into each derivative formula (for example if the derivative formula itself is undefined at c but has a limit)? In other words, should I always think in terms of limits rather than direct substitution to be safe?</div></div><div class="turn assistant"><div class="role">assistant</div><div class="content">Good question — thinking in terms of one-sided limits is the safer, more precise habit. Here’s why, and how to apply it.

- If each piece is defined and differentiable on an open interval that includes points arbitrarily close to the boundary (but possibly not the boundary itself), then the one-sided derivative equals the limit of the derivative expression as x → c±. In that common case the derivative expression is continuous at the boundary and simply plugging x = c into the derivative formula gives the same result as taking the limit.

- However, there are cases where the derivative expression is undefined at c (or has a removable singularity) even though the one-sided derivative exists. In those cases direct substitution into the derivative formula could fail or be misleading, while taking the limit of the derivative expression (or better yet, taking the difference-quotient limit) gives the correct one-sided derivative.

So yes — think in terms of limits to be safe. Concretely:

- Preferred quick method (safe when each piece is nice): differentiate each piece algebraically, then compute the one-sided derivatives by evaluating the derivative expressions at x = c (i.e., take the limit of the derivative as x → c±). If those expressions are defined and continuous at c, substitution is fine.

- Safer, always-correct method: compute the one-sided derivative directly from the definition
  left derivative = lim_{h→0−} [f(c+h) − f(c)]/h,
  right derivative = lim_{h→0+} [f(c+h) − f(c)]/h.
  This handles removable singularities and other edge cases.

Example situations where limits matter:
- A derivative expression has a factor that cancels with something in the difference quotient, producing a finite limit even though the raw derivative formula is undefined at c.
- A piece includes an absolute value or other nondifferentiable expression near c — then you should use the one-sided difference quotient to detect a corner.

In summary: using the derivative formulas and plugging in x = c is fine for “nice” pieces (polynomials, exponentials, etc.). To be rigorous in all cases, think and compute in terms of one-sided limits (or use the difference-quotient definition when in doubt). Would you like to try a small example that demonstrates a removable singularity where substitution would fail but the limit approach works?</div></div><div class="turn user"><div class="role">user</div><div class="content">Thought: I see why thinking in terms of one-sided limits is safer — plugging in x=c works when the piecewise derivative expression is defined and continuous at the boundary, but can fail with removable singularities or absolute-value-type corners. I learned that the always-correct move is to use the difference-quotient limits for each side. I feel comfortable with continuity conditions and solving for a and b now, but I want to check applying the derivative condition correctly.

Message: Thanks — that clears up the limits vs substitution issue for me. One quick question to make sure I understand: if I needed differentiability at x = 2 for our original piecewise function, I&#x27;d (1) enforce the continuity equations we already used, and then (2) set the left-hand derivative at 2 equal to the right-hand derivative at 2. For the left derivative I&#x27;d use the derivative of the left piece evaluated as x → 2− (or compute lim_{h→0−} [f(2+h)-f(2)]/h), and similarly for the right side. Is that correct? Also, in typical textbook problems with polynomials and linear pieces, is it safe to just compute the derivative formulas and plug x = 2 (i.e., the usual shortcut)?</div></div><div class="turn assistant"><div class="role">assistant</div><div class="content">Yes — that&#x27;s exactly right.

Steps for requiring differentiability at x = 2:
1) Enforce continuity at x = 2 (so the left and right limits equal the value at 2).
2) Enforce equality of one-sided derivatives at x = 2:
   - Left-hand derivative = lim_{x→2−} f&#x27;(x) for the left piece (or compute lim_{h→0−} [f(2+h) − f(2)]/h).
   - Right-hand derivative = lim_{x→2+} f&#x27;(x) for the right piece (or compute lim_{h→0+} [f(2+h) − f(2)]/h).
   - Set these equal and solve (together with the continuity condition(s)).

And yes — for typical textbook piecewise problems where each piece is a polynomial or linear function (or other “nice” differentiable expression) defined on an interval reaching up to the boundary, the usual shortcut is safe: differentiate each piece normally and plug x = 2 into each derivative expression to get the one-sided derivatives. If those derivative expressions are defined and continuous at 2, their values at 2 equal the one-sided derivative limits. Use the difference-quotient definition only when a piece is not known to be differentiable near the boundary or you suspect removable singularities or other edge cases.</div></div><div class="turn user"><div class="role">user</div><div class="content">Thought: I understand that to require differentiability at a boundary I must enforce continuity and then set the one-sided derivatives equal, and that for nice pieces I can just differentiate each piece and plug in the boundary. I learned the subtle point that using limits (difference quotient) is the safest approach when a piece has potential singularities or nondifferentiable features. I feel comfortable with continuity steps but still want to be sure when to prefer the full difference-quotient calculation.

Message: Thanks — that helps a lot. One quick question to make sure I&#x27;m using the safer habit: when a piece is a polynomial or linear (so &quot;nice&quot;), is it still good practice to mentally note &quot;one-sided limit&quot; even if I just plug in x = 2 into the derivative formulas? In other words, should I always think in terms of the one-sided derivative limits (even when I substitute) so I don&#x27;t forget edge cases?</div></div><div class="turn assistant"><div class="role">assistant</div><div class="content">Yes — that&#x27;s a good habit. Even when you use the shortcut of differentiating and substituting, mentally phrasing it as “the one-sided derivative limit from the left/right” keeps you precise and makes you less likely to miss edge cases.

Concretely:
- For a “nice” piece (polynomial, linear, etc.) it’s fine to compute f′(x) on that piece and substitute x = c to get the one-sided derivative value. But while doing so, think: “this is the limit of f′(x) as x → c− (or c+)” or equivalently “this equals lim_{h→0±}[f(c+h)−f(c)]/h.” That mental step reminds you that you’re computing a one-sided limit and that continuity (and differentiability on the open side) matters.
- If anything in the piece could make the derivative expression fail at c (absolute value, division by zero, oscillation, piece not defined arbitrarily close to c, etc.), switch to explicitly computing the appropriate one-sided difference-quotient limit instead of blind substitution.

So yes — treat substitution as shorthand for taking the one-sided derivative limits, and use the difference quotient whenever you have the slightest doubt. That way your reasoning stays correct and rigorous even in tricky cases. Would you like a very quick example to practice this habit?</div></div><div class="turn user"><div class="role">user</div><div class="content">Thought: I learned that even for nice pieces it&#x27;s best to mentally phrase substitution as taking one-sided derivative limits, and to use the difference quotient when a piece might misbehave at the boundary. I understand continuity + equality of one-sided derivatives is required for differentiability. I&#x27;m comfortable with the continuity steps we did, but I want to be sure about using the shortcut correctly in practice.

Message: Thanks — that explanation about thinking in terms of one-sided limits even when substituting was helpful and makes sense. Quick question: when a piece is a polynomial (so its derivative formula is continuous up to the boundary), is it enough to simply compute f′ for that piece and plug in x = c while mentally noting it&#x27;s the one-sided limit, or should I still write lim_{x→c±} f′(x) each time in formal solutions? Which approach do graders usually prefer in calculus problems?</div></div><div class="turn assistant"><div class="role">assistant</div><div class="content">Good question — this is about balancing rigor with economy in written solutions.

- For submission-quality answers in most calculus courses and standard exams, it is perfectly acceptable to compute f′ on each piece and then write f′(c−) = (value) and f′(c+) = (value), or simply evaluate the derivative expressions at x = c (e.g., f′_left(c) = ... and f′_right(c) = ...). Implicitly you’re using the one-sided limit idea; graders expect this shorthand when the pieces are &quot;nice&quot; (polynomials, exponentials, etc.).

- If you want to be slightly more explicit (and that’s often appreciated), you can annotate with a short phrase such as “one-sided derivative” or “limit from the right/left.” Examples:
  - “f′_-(2) = lim_{x→2−} f′_left(x) = …” or
  - “Right-hand derivative: f′_+(2) = …; Left-hand derivative: f′_-(2) = ….”
  This communicates rigor without doing the full difference-quotient computation.

- When you must be fully rigorous (e.g., a proof-based course, or when the piece has singularities or nondifferentiable features), you should use the difference-quotient definition:
  lim_{h→0+} [f(c+h) − f(c)]/h and lim_{h→0−} [f(c+h) − f(c)]/h.

What graders usually prefer
- For routine textbook/calculus problems with smooth pieces: the concise method (differentiate each piece and evaluate at the boundary, with a brief note that these are one-sided derivatives) is fine and common.
- If the problem or instructor emphasizes rigor, show the one-sided limit notation or the difference-quotient form — especially if there is any chance of ambiguity.

So, practice the habit of thinking “one-sided limits,” and in written answers either (a) use the concise derivative-evaluate shorthand and name them one-sided derivatives, or (b) write the one-sided limit expressions when you want to be fully explicit. Both are acceptable; choose based on the course expectations and the complexity of the pieces.</div></div><div class="turn user"><div class="role">user</div><div class="content">Thought: I understand now that when pieces are nice I can usually just compute derivatives and plug in the boundary while mentally treating that as a one-sided limit.

Message: Thanks — that cleared up my confusion about substitution vs. limits. Quick question: when I write a short answer on a midterm (not a proof class), is this phrasing safe and concise enough?

“Compute f′ on each piece and evaluate at x = 2 to get the one-sided derivatives f′_-(2) and f′_+(2); set them equal.”

Graders usually expect the concise form, and they understand that “evaluate at x = 2” for piecewise pieces means you are taking one-sided derivatives.

- Short, safe, and usually sufficient:
  “Compute f′ on each piece and evaluate at x = 2 to get the one-sided derivatives f′_-(2) and f′_+(2); set them equal.”

- Slightly more explicit (if you want to be extra careful):
  “Compute f′ on each piece and evaluate at x = 2 to get the one-sided derivatives f′_-(2) and f′_+(2) (interpreted as one-sided limits); set them equal.”

If you know your instructor/TA is strict about rigor, include the parenthetical. Otherwise the shorter version is perfectly acceptable and shows you know what you’re doing.

Message: Thanks — that makes sense. I’ll use the concise phrasing on most midterms and add “(interpreted as one-sided limits)” when the instructor is strict.

Quick question: for a moderately strict grader, is the shorthand f′_-(c) and f′_+(c) (with the parenthetical) sufficient, or should I write the explicit one-sided limit notation lim_{x→c±} f′(x) to be safe?</div></div><div class="turn assistant"><div class="role">assistant</div><div class="content">For a moderately strict grader, the shorthand f′_-(c) and f′_+(c) together with the parenthetical clarification is usually sufficient. It shows you know you mean one-sided derivatives and that you’re not confusing two-sided differentiability with simply evaluating a derivative across a jump.

If you want to be extra safe (or if the grader is known to be very pedantic), write one of these slightly more explicit forms:

- f′_-(c) = lim_{x→c−} f′(x) and f′_+(c) = lim_{x→c+} f′(x)  — concise and clear; or
- f′_-(c) = lim_{h→0−} [f(c+h) − f(c)]/h and f′_+(c) = lim_{h→0+} [f(c+h) − f(c)]/h  — fully rigorous from first principles.

Recommendation:
- On most midterms: use f′_-(c) and f′_+(c) with the parenthetical “(interpreted as one-sided limits)”.
- If you know the grader is strict or the function has potential issues (absolute values, divisions by zero, removable singularities), either write the lim_{x→c±} f′(x) form or the difference-quotient limits.

Either choice will be accepted by a moderately strict grader; reserve the difference-quotient form for when you need to show actual limit work.</div></div><div class="turn user"><div class="role">user</div><div class="content">Thought: I learned that using f′_-(c) and f′_+(c) with a parenthetical is usually fine for a moderately strict grader, and that if I need extra rigor I can write lim_{x→c±} f′(x) or the difference-quotient limits. I should ask a focused clarification about when to prefer the lim_{x→c±} f′(x) form over the difference-quotient form.

Message: Thanks — that helped. Quick question: when the piece formulas are “nice” but one of them has a removable singularity at the boundary (so f′(x) as an expression might be undefined exactly at c but has a finite limit), should I prefer writing f′_-(c) = lim_{x→c−} f′(x) (the derivative-expression limit) or the difference-quotient form lim_{h→0−}[f(c+h)−f(c)]/h in my written solution to be both concise and fully correct? Which do graders usually prefer in that specific removable-singularity case?</div></div><div class="turn assistant"><div class="role">assistant</div><div class="content">Good question — this is one of those edge cases where clarity and a little extra rigor pay off.

If a piece has a removable singularity at the boundary (so the formal derivative expression f′(x) is undefined at x = c but has a finite limit as x → c±), graders generally prefer you to show the justification that the one-sided derivative exists. You have two reasonable choices:

- Concise but explicit: write f′_-(c) = lim_{x→c−} f′(x) and evaluate that limit. This is compact and usually acceptable when it’s clear that the only issue is a removable singularity (i.e., the expression has a limit). It signals you are taking a one-sided limit of the derivative expression rather than naively plugging in.

- Fully rigorous (recommended if you want to be beyond dispute): use the difference-quotient definition
  f′_-(c) = lim_{h→0−} [f(c+h) − f(c)]/h
and perform the algebraic cancellations there. This is longer but shows you handled the removable singularity correctly rather than relying on a possibly undefined symbolic derivative at c.

Which to choose
- If you want to be concise and the simplification in the derivative-expression limit is straightforward (the removable singularity is obvious and the limit is easy), the derivative-expression limit (lim_{x→c±} f′(x)) is fine — but add a brief note like “(derivative expression has a removable singularity; taking the limit)” so the grader knows you considered the issue.
- If the removable singularity requires cancellation or subtle algebra to reveal the finite limit, use the difference-quotient form so you explicitly show the cancellation and obtain the limit from first principles.

In short: for most midterms, lim_{x→c±} f′(x) with a short note is acceptable; for maximum rigor (or if cancellation is nontrivial), show the difference-quotient. That approach balances concision and correctness and matches typical grader expectations.</div></div></div>
