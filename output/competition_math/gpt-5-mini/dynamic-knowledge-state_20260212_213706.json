In that common case the derivative expression is continuous at the boundary and simply plugging x = c into the derivative formula gives the same result as taking the limit.\n\n- However, there are cases where the derivative expression is undefined at c (or has a removable singularity) even though the one-sided derivative exists. In those cases direct substitution into the derivative formula could fail or be misleading, while taking the limit of the derivative expression (or better yet, taking the difference-quotient limit) gives the correct one-sided derivative.\n\nSo yes \u2014 think in terms of limits to be safe.

        "Good question \u2014 this is one of those edge cases where clarity and a little extra rigor pay off.\n\nIf a piece has a removable singularity at the boundary (so the formal derivative expression f\u2032(x) is undefined at x = c but has a finite limit as x \u2192 c\u00b1), graders generally prefer you to show the justification that the one-sided derivative exists.

    "conversation_history": "- You: Can you show me how to set up the continuity conditions at x = 2 and x = -2 for this piecewise function, and how those conditions lead to equations involving a and b?\n- AI Tutor: Good \u2014 continuity of a piecewise function at the borderpoints means the left and right limits at each border equal the function value there. The borders here are x = 2 and x = \u22122. Let\u2019s set up the needed equalities step by step; I\u2019ll ask a couple of guiding questions as we go.\n\n1) At x = 2:\n- Which piece applies at x = 2 exactly? (Look at the inequalities.)\n- What is the value of f(2) from that piece?\n- What is the right-hand value (limit as x \u2192 2+) from the piece for x > 2?\n- For continuity at 2, what equality must those two values satisfy?\n\n2) At x = \u22122:\n- Which piece applies at x = \u22122 exactly?\n- What is f(\u22122) from that piece?\n- What is the left-hand value (limit as x \u2192 \u22122\u2212) from the piece for x < \u22122?\n- For continuity at \u22122, what equality must those two values satisfy?\n\nNow fill in the expressions:\n\n- For x = 2: the middle piece (\u22122 \u2264 x \u2264 2) gives f(2) = 2 \u2212 5. The right-piece (x > 2) gives the limit from the right as a\u00b72 + 3. Continuity at 2 requires\n  a\u00b72 + 3 = 2 \u2212 5.\n\n- For x = \u22122: the middle piece (\u22122 \u2264 x \u2264 2) gives f(\u22122) = (\u22122) \u2212 5. The left-piece (x < \u22122) gives the left-hand limit as 2\u00b7(\u22122) \u2212 b. Continuity at \u22122 requires\n  2\u00b7(\u22122) \u2212 b = (\u22122) \u2212 5.\n\nThose are the two equations in a and b. Do you want to solve them now to find a and b (and then a + b), or would you like a hint for solving each equation?\n- You: Thanks \u2014 I see the two equations you wrote:\n1) 2a + 3 = 2 \u2212 5\n2) 2\u00b7(\u22122) \u2212 b = (\u22122) \u2212 5\n\nI'm not confident solving these for a and b yet. Could you show the next algebra step for the first equation (solving for a)? After that I can try the second one and tell you what I get.\n- AI Tutor: Sure \u2014 let\u2019s solve the first equation step by step.\n\nYou have 2a + 3 = 2 \u2212 5. First simplify the right side: 2 \u2212 5 = \u22123. So the equation becomes\n2a + 3 = \u22123.\n\nNext subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the 2a term:\n2a = \u22123 \u2212 3 = \u22126.\n\nFinally divide both sides by 2:\na = \u22126 / 2 = \u22123.\n\nNow you can try the second equation 2\u00b7(\u22122) \u2212 b = (\u22122) \u2212 5. What do you get for b?\n- You: Okay, I'll try the second one now: 2\u00b7(\u22122) \u2212 b = (\u22122) \u2212 5. First I simplify both sides: 2\u00b7(\u22122) = \u22124, and (\u22122) \u2212 5 = \u22127. So the equation becomes \u22124 \u2212 b = \u22127. Next I want to isolate b \u2014 should I add 4 to both sides (giving \u2212b = \u22127 + 4 = \u22123) and then multiply both sides by \u22121 to get b = 3? Is that the correct next step and final value for b?\n- AI Tutor: Yes \u2014 your steps are correct.\n\nStarting from \u22124 \u2212 b = \u22127, adding 4 to both sides gives \u2212b = \u22123. Multiplying both sides by \u22121 yields b = 3.\n\nYou now have a = \u22123 and b = 3. If you want, compute a + b next. What do you get?\n- You: Okay \u2014 I see how you solved for a and b using those continuity equations. To combine them, do I just add the two values together (a + b = \u22123 + 3)? If so, that gives 0. Is that the final quantity we should report, or is there another step I should consider after finding a + b?\n- AI Tutor: Yes \u2014 you just add the values you found: a + b = (\u22123) + 3 = 0. That's the final answer; no further steps are needed. Good work checking each step.\n- You: Thanks \u2014 that explanation helped me learn how continuity gives the equations and how to solve them. I understand a = \u22123 and b = 3, and that a + b = 0 is the final reported value. Is there ever a case where, after finding parameters from continuity, we would need to check anything else (like differentiability or domain restrictions), or is reporting the parameter sum typically sufficient for this kind of question?\n- AI Tutor: Good question \u2014 glad you asked.\n\nFor this specific problem, asking for a and b (or a + b) under the condition that the piecewise function is continuous, once you ensure the left and right limits equal the function value at each boundary, you\u2019re done. Reporting a + b = 0 is sufficient.\n\nHowever, in other problems you might need to check additional things depending on what\u2019s asked:\n\n- Differentiability: If the question requires the function to be differentiable at a boundary, you must also set the left and right derivatives equal there and solve those equations (which can give extra constraints or force different parameter values).\n- Domain or function-definition issues: Sometimes a point in the interval may not be included in any piece (e.g., open intervals leaving a hole); you then must ensure the function is actually defined there or modify the definition.\n- Multiple boundary points: If there are several boundaries, you need to impose continuity at each one (as we did at x = 2 and x = \u22122).\n- Consistency checks: Occasionally the continuity equations can be contradictory (no solution) or underdetermined (infinitely many solutions); you should note that outcome if it occurs.\n- Contextual constraints: If parameters are supposed to be integers, positive, etc., you must respect those extra conditions.\n\nSo for continuity-only problems like this one, solving the continuity conditions and reporting the requested combination (a + b) is typically sufficient. If the problem asked for differentiability or had extra constraints, you\u2019d need extra steps.\n- You: Thanks \u2014 that clarifies everything for me. I see why a = \u22123 and b = 3, and why a + b = 0 is the final answer here. One quick question: if a problem did require differentiability at a boundary, would I always set the left and right derivatives equal at that point (in addition to continuity)?\n- AI Tutor: Yes \u2014 if a problem requires differentiability at a boundary point, you must have both continuity and equality of the left and right derivatives at that point. More precisely:\n\n- First ensure continuity at the point: the left-hand limit, the value at the point (if defined), and the right-hand limit must all be equal.\n- Then enforce differentiability: the left-hand derivative (limit of the difference quotient from the left) must equal the right-hand derivative (limit from the right).\n\nIn practice, for piecewise-defined functions made of simple expressions (polynomials, linear pieces, etc.), that means:\n\n- Compute the derivative formula on each side of the boundary (for x < c and x > c).\n- Evaluate each derivative at the boundary point (taking the limit as x \u2192 c from the left and right).\n- Set those two numbers equal and solve for the parameters, along with the continuity equations.\n\nExample (brief sketch): if you had\nf(x) = { ax + 3 for x > 2; x \u2212 5 for x \u2264 2 }\nthen differentiability at x = 2 would require:\n- continuity: a\u00b72 + 3 = 2 \u2212 5 (as we did), and\n- derivative equality: derivative on the right is a, derivative on the left is 1, so a = 1.\n\nNote that continuity is necessary for differentiability, but not sufficient: having equal derivatives (and both sides defined) ensures differentiability.\n\nAlso be aware of cases where derivatives don't exist (cusps, corners, vertical tangents) \u2014 then no choice of parameters can make the function differentiable there.\n- You: Thanks \u2014 that explanation cleared things up. One quick thing I want to check: when computing the left and right derivatives at the boundary, do I always take the derivative formulas for the pieces and then evaluate them at the point (i.e., take limits of the derivative expressions as x \u2192 c\u00b1), or are there cases where I need to compute the limit of the difference quotient directly instead of just plugging into the derivative expressions?\n- AI Tutor: Good question \u2014 the short answer is: usually you can take the derivative formulas for each piece and evaluate their limits at the boundary, but there are situations where you should go back to the difference quotient and compute one- or two-sided limits directly.\n\nHere\u2019s how to decide which approach to use:\n\n1) When it's safe to evaluate derivative formulas\n- If each piece is differentiable on an open interval that reaches up to (but not across) the boundary point (for example, polynomials, exponentials, trig, etc.), then you can compute the derivative on each piece by ordinary differentiation and evaluate the one-sided derivatives by taking the limit of those derivative expressions as x \u2192 c\u2212 and x \u2192 c+. For linear and polynomial pieces this is automatic and safe.\n- In practice most textbook piecewise problems use standard differentiable expressions on each side, so this shortcut works.\n\n2) When you should compute the difference quotient directly\n- If the piece is not known to be differentiable at points arbitrarily close to the boundary (e.g., it contains an absolute value, a piece that itself has a corner, or a formula defined only at isolated points), you must use the limit of the difference quotient from the appropriate side:\n  lim_{h\u21920+} [f(c+h) \u2212 f(c)]/h for the right-hand derivative,\n  lim_{h\u21920\u2212} [f(c+h) \u2212 f(c)]/h for the left-hand derivative.\n- If the derivative formula has a removable singularity or involves expressions that are undefined at the boundary but have a limit (for example rational expressions that cancel), directly computing the difference quotient may be necessary to capture cancellation before taking the limit.\n- If you suspect the derivative might not exist even though the expressions look differentiable (for instance due to oscillation, or because the function definitions change in a complicated way), use the difference-quotient definition to be sure.\n\nA helpful rule of thumb\n- If each side is given by a nice differentiable formula on an interval reaching the boundary, differentiate the piecewise formulas and evaluate at the boundary from the appropriate side.\n- If either side is nonstandard, nondifferentiable, or involves potential cancellation/undefined expressions at the boundary, compute the one-sided difference quotients.\n\nWould you like to try a short example where using the derivative formulas works, and one where you must use the difference quotient? I can guide you through either.\n- You: Thanks \u2014 that clarification helped. One quick thing I'm unsure about: when evaluating the derivative formulas at the boundary, you said to take the limit of the derivative expressions as x \u2192 c\u00b1. Is that ever different from simply plugging x = c into each derivative formula (for example if the derivative formula itself is undefined at c but has a limit)? In other words, should I always think in terms of limits rather than direct substitution to be safe?\n- AI Tutor: Good question \u2014 thinking in terms of one-sided limits is the safer, more precise habit. Here\u2019s why, and how to apply it.\n\n- If each piece is defined and differentiable on an open interval that includes points arbitrarily close to the boundary (but possibly not the boundary itself), then the one-sided derivative equals the limit of the derivative expression as x \u2192 c\u00b1. In that common case the derivative expression is continuous at the boundary and simply plugging x = c into the derivative formula gives the same result as taking the limit.\n\n- However, there are cases where the derivative expression is undefined at c (or has a removable singularity) even though the one-sided derivative exists. In those cases direct substitution into the derivative formula could fail or be misleading, while taking the limit of the derivative expression (or better yet, taking the difference-quotient limit) gives the correct one-sided derivative.\n\nSo yes \u2014 think in terms of limits to be safe. Concretely:\n\n- Preferred quick method (safe when each piece is nice): differentiate each piece algebraically, then compute the one-sided derivatives by evaluating the derivative expressions at x = c (i.e., take the limit of the derivative as x \u2192 c\u00b1). If those expressions are defined and continuous at c, substitution is fine.\n\n- Safer, always-correct method: compute the one-sided derivative directly from the definition\n  left derivative = lim_{h\u21920\u2212} [f(c+h) \u2212 f(c)]/h,\n  right derivative = lim_{h\u21920+} [f(c+h) \u2212 f(c)]/h.\n  This handles removable singularities and other edge cases.\n\nExample situations where limits matter:\n- A derivative expression has a factor that cancels with something in the difference quotient, producing a finite limit even though the raw derivative formula is undefined at c.\n- A piece includes an absolute value or other nondifferentiable expression near c \u2014 then you should use the one-sided difference quotient to detect a corner.\n\nIn summary: using the derivative formulas and plugging in x = c is fine for \u201cnice\u201d pieces (polynomials, exponentials, etc.). To be rigorous in all cases, think and compute in terms of one-sided limits (or use the difference-quotient definition when in doubt). Would you like to try a small example that demonstrates a removable singularity where substitution would fail but the limit approach works?\n- You: Thanks \u2014 that clears up the limits vs substitution issue for me. One quick question to make sure I understand: if I needed differentiability at x = 2 for our original piecewise function, I'd (1) enforce the continuity equations we already used, and then (2) set the left-hand derivative at 2 equal to the right-hand derivative at 2. For the left derivative I'd use the derivative of the left piece evaluated as x \u2192 2\u2212 (or compute lim_{h\u21920\u2212} [f(2+h)-f(2)]/h), and similarly for the right side. Is that correct? Also, in typical textbook problems with polynomials and linear pieces, is it safe to just compute the derivative formulas and plug x = 2 (i.e., the usual shortcut)?\n- AI Tutor: Yes \u2014 that's exactly right.\n\nSteps for requiring differentiability at x = 2:\n1) Enforce continuity at x = 2 (so the left and right limits equal the value at 2).\n2) Enforce equality of one-sided derivatives at x = 2:\n   - Left-hand derivative = lim_{x\u21922\u2212} f'(x) for the left piece (or compute lim_{h\u21920\u2212} [f(2+h) \u2212 f(2)]/h).\n   - Right-hand derivative = lim_{x\u21922+} f'(x) for the right piece (or compute lim_{h\u21920+} [f(2+h) \u2212 f(2)]/h).\n   - Set these equal and solve (together with the continuity condition(s)).\n\nAnd yes \u2014 for typical textbook piecewise problems where each piece is a polynomial or linear function (or other \u201cnice\u201d differentiable expression) defined on an interval reaching up to the boundary, the usual shortcut is safe: differentiate each piece normally and plug x = 2 into each derivative expression to get the one-sided derivatives. If those derivative expressions are defined and continuous at 2, their values at 2 equal the one-sided derivative limits. Use the difference-quotient definition only when a piece is not known to be differentiable near the boundary or you suspect removable singularities or other edge cases.\n- You: Thanks \u2014 that helps a lot. One quick question to make sure I'm using the safer habit: when a piece is a polynomial or linear (so \"nice\"), is it still good practice to mentally note \"one-sided limit\" even if I just plug in x = 2 into the derivative formulas? In other words, should I always think in terms of the one-sided derivative limits (even when I substitute) so I don't forget edge cases?\n- AI Tutor: Yes \u2014 that's a good habit. Even when you use the shortcut of differentiating and substituting, mentally phrasing it as \u201cthe one-sided derivative limit from the left/right\u201d keeps you precise and makes you less likely to miss edge cases.\n\nConcretely:\n- For a \u201cnice\u201d piece (polynomial, linear, etc.) it\u2019s fine to compute f\u2032(x) on that piece and substitute x = c to get the one-sided derivative value. But while doing so, think: \u201cthis is the limit of f\u2032(x) as x \u2192 c\u2212 (or c+)\u201d or equivalently \u201cthis equals lim_{h\u21920\u00b1}[f(c+h)\u2212f(c)]/h.\u201d That mental step reminds you that you\u2019re computing a one-sided limit and that continuity (and differentiability on the open side) matters.\n- If anything in the piece could make the derivative expression fail at c (absolute value, division by zero, oscillation, piece not defined arbitrarily close to c, etc.), switch to explicitly computing the appropriate one-sided difference-quotient limit instead of blind substitution.\n\nSo yes \u2014 treat substitution as shorthand for taking the one-sided derivative limits, and use the difference quotient whenever you have the slightest doubt. That way your reasoning stays correct and rigorous even in tricky cases. Would you like a very quick example to practice this habit?\n- You: Thanks \u2014 that explanation about thinking in terms of one-sided limits even when substituting was helpful and makes sense. Quick question: when a piece is a polynomial (so its derivative formula is continuous up to the boundary), is it enough to simply compute f\u2032 for that piece and plug in x = c while mentally noting it's the one-sided limit, or should I still write lim_{x\u2192c\u00b1} f\u2032(x) each time in formal solutions? Which approach do graders usually prefer in calculus problems?\n- AI Tutor: Good question \u2014 this is about balancing rigor with economy in written solutions.\n\n- For submission-quality answers in most calculus courses and standard exams, it is perfectly acceptable to compute f\u2032 on each piece and then write f\u2032(c\u2212) = (value) and f\u2032(c+) = (value), or simply evaluate the derivative expressions at x = c (e.g., f\u2032_left(c) = ... and f\u2032_right(c) = ...). Implicitly you\u2019re using the one-sided limit idea; graders expect this shorthand when the pieces are \"nice\" (polynomials, exponentials, etc.).\n\n- If you want to be slightly more explicit (and that\u2019s often appreciated), you can annotate with a short phrase such as \u201cone-sided derivative\u201d or \u201climit from the right/left.\u201d Examples:\n  - \u201cf\u2032_-(2) = lim_{x\u21922\u2212} f\u2032_left(x) = \u2026\u201d or\n  - \u201cRight-hand derivative: f\u2032_+(2) = \u2026; Left-hand derivative: f\u2032_-(2) = \u2026.\u201d\n  This communicates rigor without doing the full difference-quotient computation.\n\n- When you must be fully rigorous (e.g., a proof-based course, or when the piece has singularities or nondifferentiable features), you should use the difference-quotient definition:\n  lim_{h\u21920+} [f(c+h) \u2212 f(c)]/h and lim_{h\u21920\u2212} [f(c+h) \u2212 f(c)]/h.\n\nWhat graders usually prefer\n- For routine textbook/calculus problems with smooth pieces: the concise method (differentiate each piece and evaluate at the boundary, with a brief note that these are one-sided derivatives) is fine and common.\n- If the problem or instructor emphasizes rigor, show the one-sided limit notation or the difference-quotient form \u2014 especially if there is any chance of ambiguity.\n\nSo, practice the habit of thinking \u201cone-sided limits,\u201d and in written answers either (a) use the concise derivative-evaluate shorthand and name them one-sided derivatives, or (b) write the one-sided limit expressions when you want to be fully explicit. Both are acceptable; choose based on the course expectations and the complexity of the pieces.\n- You: Thanks \u2014 that cleared up my confusion about substitution vs. limits. Quick question: when I write a short answer on a midterm (not a proof class), is this phrasing safe and concise enough?\n\n\u201cCompute f\u2032 on each piece and evaluate at x = 2 to get the one-sided derivatives f\u2032_-(2) and f\u2032_+(2); set them equal.\u201d\n\nOr should I add a parenthetical like \u201c(interpreted as one-sided limits)\u201d to be safe? Which of those two would graders usually prefer?\n- AI Tutor: Both phrasings are fine for a typical midterm in a standard calculus course. Graders usually expect the concise form, and they understand that \u201cevaluate at x = 2\u201d for piecewise pieces means you are taking one-sided derivatives. Which to use depends on how picky the instructor is:\n\n- Short, safe, and usually sufficient:\n  \u201cCompute f\u2032 on each piece and evaluate at x = 2 to get the one-sided derivatives f\u2032_-(2) and f\u2032_+(2); set them equal.\u201d\n\n- Slightly more explicit (if you want to be extra careful):\n  \u201cCompute f\u2032 on each piece and evaluate at x = 2 to get the one-sided derivatives f\u2032_-(2) and f\u2032_+(2) (interpreted as one-sided limits); set them equal.\u201d\n\nIf you know your instructor/TA is strict about rigor, include the parenthetical. Otherwise the shorter version is perfectly acceptable and shows you know what you\u2019re doing. Which would you prefer to use on your next exam?\n- You: Thanks \u2014 that makes sense. I\u2019ll use the concise phrasing on most midterms and add \u201c(interpreted as one-sided limits)\u201d when the instructor is strict. One quick follow-up: if I include the parenthetical, is it better to write it right after \u201cone-sided derivatives\u201d or at the end of the sentence?\n- AI Tutor: Either placement works, but putting the parenthetical right after \u201cone-sided derivatives\u201d is slightly clearer and more direct. That way the reader immediately knows how you interpret those symbols. For example:\n\n\u201cCompute f\u2032 on each piece and evaluate at x = 2 to get the one-sided derivatives f\u2032_-(2) and f\u2032_+(2) (interpreted as one-sided limits); set them equal.\u201d\n\nPlacing it at the end of the sentence is also acceptable, but might force the reader to finish the sentence before seeing the clarification. So prefer the first placement for clarity.\n- You: I\u2019ll put the parenthetical right after \u201cone-sided derivatives\u201d for clarity. Quick question: for a moderately strict grader, is the shorthand f\u2032_-(c) and f\u2032_+(c) (with the parenthetical) sufficient, or should I write the explicit one-sided limit notation lim_{x\u2192c\u00b1} f\u2032(x) to be safe?\n- AI Tutor: For a moderately strict grader, the shorthand f\u2032_-(c) and f\u2032_+(c) together with the parenthetical clarification is usually sufficient. It shows you know you mean one-sided derivatives and that you\u2019re not confusing two-sided differentiability with simply evaluating a derivative across a jump.\n\nIf you want to be extra safe (or if the grader is known to be very pedantic), write one of these slightly more explicit forms:\n\n- f\u2032_-(c) = lim_{x\u2192c\u2212} f\u2032(x) and f\u2032_+(c) = lim_{x\u2192c+} f\u2032(x)  \u2014 concise and clear; or\n- f\u2032_-(c) = lim_{h\u21920\u2212} [f(c+h) \u2212 f(c)]/h and f\u2032_+(c) = lim_{h\u21920+} [f(c+h) \u2212 f(c)]/h  \u2014 fully rigorous from first principles.\n\nRecommendation:\n- On most midterms: use f\u2032_-(c) and f\u2032_+(c) with the parenthetical \u201c(interpreted as one-sided limits)\u201d.\n- If you know the grader is strict or the function has potential issues (absolute values, divisions by zero, removable singularities), either write the lim_{x\u2192c\u00b1} f\u2032(x) form or the difference-quotient limits.\n\nEither choice will be accepted by a moderately strict grader; reserve the difference-quotient form for when you need to show actual limit work.\n- You: Thanks \u2014 that helped. Quick question: when the piece formulas are \u201cnice\u201d but one of them has a removable singularity at the boundary (so f\u2032(x) as an expression might be undefined exactly at c but has a finite limit), should I prefer writing f\u2032_-(c) = lim_{x\u2192c\u2212} f\u2032(x) (the derivative-expression limit) or the difference-quotient form lim_{h\u21920\u2212}[f(c+h)\u2212f(c)]/h in my written solution to be both concise and fully correct? Which do graders usually prefer in that specific removable-singularity case?\n- AI Tutor: Good question \u2014 this is one of those edge cases where clarity and a little extra rigor pay off.\n\nIf a piece has a removable singularity at the boundary (so the formal derivative expression f\u2032(x) is undefined at x = c but has a finite limit as x \u2192 c\u00b1), graders generally prefer you to show the justification that the one-sided derivative exists. You have two reasonable choices:\n\n- Concise but explicit: write f\u2032_-(c) = lim_{x\u2192c\u2212} f\u2032(x) and evaluate that limit. This is compact and usually acceptable when it\u2019s clear that the only issue is a removable singularity (i.e., the expression has a limit). It signals you are taking a one-sided limit of the derivative expression rather than naively plugging in.\n\n- Fully rigorous (recommended if you want to be beyond dispute): use the difference-quotient definition\n  f\u2032_-(c) = lim_{h\u21920\u2212} [f(c+h) \u2212 f(c)]/h\nand perform the algebraic cancellations there. This is longer but shows you handled the removable singularity correctly rather than relying on a possibly undefined symbolic derivative at c.\n\nWhich to choose\n- If you want to be concise and the simplification in the derivative-expression limit is straightforward (the removable singularity is obvious and the limit is easy), the derivative-expression limit (lim_{x\u2192c\u00b1} f\u2032(x)) is fine \u2014 but add a brief note like \u201c(derivative expression has a removable singularity; taking the limit)\u201d so the grader knows you considered the issue.\n- If the removable singularity requires cancellation or subtle algebra to reveal the finite limit, use the difference-quotient form so you explicitly show the cancellation and obtain the limit from first principles.\n\nIn short: for most midterms, lim_{x\u2192c\u00b1} f\u2032(x) with a short note is acceptable; for maximum rigor (or if cancellation is nontrivial), show the difference-quotient. That approach balances concision and correctness and matches typical grader expectations.\n",

Reporting a + b = 0 is sufficient.\n\nHowever, in other problems you might need to check additional things depending on what\u2019s asked:\n\n- Differentiability: If the question requires the function to be differentiable at a boundary, you must also set the left and right derivatives equal there and solve those equations (which can give extra constraints or force different parameter values).\n- Domain or function-definition issues: Sometimes a point in the interval may not be included in any piece (e.g., open intervals leaving a hole); you then must ensure the function is actually defined there or modify the definition.\n- Multiple boundary points: If there are several boundaries, you need to impose continuity at each one (as we did at x = 2 and x = \u22122).\n- Consistency checks: Occasionally the continuity equations can be contradictory (no solution) or underdetermined (infinitely many solutions); you should note that outcome if it occurs.\n- Contextual constraints: If parameters are supposed to be integers, positive, etc., you must respect those extra conditions.\n\nSo for continuity-only problems like this one, solving the continuity conditions and reporting the requested combination (a + b) is typically sufficient.

Here\u2019s why, and how to apply it.\n\n- If each piece is defined and differentiable on an open interval that includes points arbitrarily close to the boundary (but possibly not the boundary itself), then the one-sided derivative equals the limit of the derivative expression as x \u2192 c\u00b1. In that common case the derivative expression is continuous at the boundary and simply plugging x = c into the derivative formula gives the same result as taking the limit.\n\n- However, there are cases where the derivative expression is undefined at c (or has a removable singularity) even though the one-sided derivative exists. In those cases direct substitution into the derivative formula could fail or be misleading, while taking the limit of the derivative expression (or better yet, taking the difference-quotient limit) gives the correct one-sided derivative.\n\nSo yes \u2014 think in terms of limits to be safe. Concretely:\n\n- Preferred quick method (safe when each piece is nice): differentiate each piece algebraically, then compute the one-sided derivatives by evaluating the derivative expressions at x = c (i.e., take the limit of the derivative as x \u2192 c\u00b1). If those expressions are defined and continuous at c, substitution is fine.\n\n- Safer, always-correct method: compute the one-sided derivative directly from the definition\n  left derivative = lim_{h\u21920\u2212} [f(c+h) \u2212 f(c)]/h,\n  right derivative = lim_{h\u21920+} [f(c+h) \u2212 f(c)]/h.\n  This handles removable singularities and other edge cases.\n\nExample situations where limits matter:\n- A derivative expression has a factor that cancels with something in the difference quotient, producing a finite limit even though the raw derivative formula is undefined at c.\n- A piece includes an absolute value or other nondifferentiable expression near c \u2014 then you should use the one-sided difference quotient to detect a corner.\n\nIn summary: using the derivative formulas and plugging in x = c is fine for \u201cnice\u201d pieces (polynomials, exponentials, etc.). To be rigorous in all cases, think and compute in terms of one-sided limits (or use the difference-quotient definition when in doubt).

One quick question to make sure I'm using the safer habit: when a piece is a polynomial or linear (so \"nice\"), is it still good practice to mentally note \"one-sided limit\" even if I just plug in x = 2 into the derivative formulas? In other words, should I always think in terms of the one-sided derivative limits (even when I substitute) so I don't forget edge cases?"

        "content": "Yes \u2014 that's a good habit. Even when you use the shortcut of differentiating and substituting, mentally phrasing it as \u201cthe one-sided derivative limit from the left/right\u201d keeps you precise and makes you less likely to miss edge cases.\n\nConcretely:\n- For a \u201cnice\u201d piece (polynomial, linear, etc.) it\u2019s fine to compute f\u2032(x) on that piece and substitute x = c to get the one-sided derivative value. But while doing so, think: \u201cthis is the limit of f\u2032(x) as x \u2192 c\u2212 (or c+)\u201d or equivalently \u201cthis equals lim_{h\u21920\u00b1}[f(c+h)\u2212f(c)]/h.\u201d That mental step reminds you that you\u2019re computing a one-sided limit and that continuity (and differentiability on the open side) matters.\n- If anything in the piece could make the derivative expression fail at c (absolute value, division by zero, oscillation, piece not defined arbitrarily close to c, etc.), switch to explicitly computing the appropriate one-sided difference-quotient limit instead of blind substitution.\n\nSo yes \u2014 treat substitution as shorthand for taking the one-sided derivative limits, and use the difference quotient whenever you have the slightest doubt. That way your reasoning stays correct and rigorous even in tricky cases. Would you like a very quick example to practice this habit?"

The borders here are x = 2 and x = \u22122. Let\u2019s set up the needed equalities step by step; I\u2019ll ask a couple of guiding questions as we go.\n\n1) At x = 2:\n- Which piece applies at x = 2 exactly? (Look at the inequalities.)\n- What is the value of f(2) from that piece?\n- What is the right-hand value (limit as x \u2192 2+) from the piece for x > 2?\n- For continuity at 2, what equality must those two values satisfy?\n\n2) At x = \u22122:\n- Which piece applies at x = \u22122 exactly?\n- What is f(\u22122) from that piece?\n- What is the left-hand value (limit as x \u2192 \u22122\u2212) from the piece for x < \u22122?\n- For continuity at \u22122, what equality must those two values satisfy?\n\nNow fill in the expressions:\n\n- For x = 2: the middle piece (\u22122 \u2264 x \u2264 2) gives f(2) = 2 \u2212 5. The right-piece (x > 2) gives the limit from the right as a\u00b72 + 3. Continuity at 2 requires\n  a\u00b72 + 3 = 2 \u2212 5.\n\n- For x = \u22122: the middle piece (\u22122 \u2264 x \u2264 2) gives f(\u22122) = (\u22122) \u2212 5. The left-piece (x < \u22122) gives the left-hand limit as 2\u00b7(\u22122) \u2212 b. Continuity at \u22122 requires\n  2\u00b7(\u22122) \u2212 b = (\u22122) \u2212 5.\n\nThose are the two equations in a and b. Do you want to solve them now to find a and b (and then a + b), or would you like a hint for solving each equation?\n- You: Thanks \u2014 I see the two equations you wrote:\n1) 2a + 3 = 2 \u2212 5\n2) 2\u00b7(\u22122) \u2212 b = (\u22122) \u2212 5\n\nI'm not confident solving these for a and b yet. Could you show the next algebra step for the first equation (solving for a)? After that I can try the second one and tell you what I get.\n- AI Tutor: Sure \u2014 let\u2019s solve the first equation step by step.\n\nYou have 2a + 3 = 2 \u2212 5. First simplify the right side: 2 \u2212 5 = \u22123. So the equation becomes\n2a + 3 = \u22123.\n\nNext subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the 2a term:\n2a = \u22123 \u2212 3 = \u22126.\n\nFinally divide both sides by 2:\na = \u22126 / 2 = \u22123.\n\nNow you can try the second equation 2\u00b7(\u22122) \u2212 b = (\u22122) \u2212 5. What do you get for b?\n- You: Okay, I'll try the second one now: 2\u00b7(\u22122) \u2212 b = (\u22122) \u2212 5. First I simplify both sides: 2\u00b7(\u22122) = \u22124, and (\u22122) \u2212 5 = \u22127. So the equation becomes \u22124 \u2212 b = \u22127. Next I want to isolate b \u2014 should I add 4 to both sides (giving \u2212b = \u22127 + 4 = \u22123) and then multiply both sides by \u22121 to get b = 3? Is that the correct next step and final value for b?\n- AI Tutor: Yes \u2014 your steps are correct.\n\nStarting from \u22124 \u2212 b = \u22127, adding 4 to both sides gives \u2212b = \u22123. Multiplying both sides by \u22121 yields b = 3.\n\nYou now have a = \u22123 and b = 3. If you want, compute a + b next. What do you get?\n- You: Okay \u2014 I see how you solved for a and b using those continuity equations. To combine them, do I just add the two values together (a + b = \u22123 + 3)? If so, that gives 0. Is that the final quantity we should report, or is there another step I should consider after finding a + b?\n- AI Tutor: Yes \u2014 you just add the values you found: a + b = (\u22123) + 3 = 0. That's the final answer; no further steps are needed. Good work checking each step.\n- You: Thanks \u2014 that explanation helped me learn how continuity gives the equations and how to solve them. I understand a = \u22123 and b = 3, and that a + b = 0 is the final reported value. Is there ever a case where, after finding parameters from continuity, we would need to check anything else (like differentiability or domain restrictions), or is reporting the parameter sum typically sufficient for this kind of question?\n- AI Tutor: Good question \u2014 glad you asked.\n\nFor this specific problem, asking for a and b (or a + b) under the condition that the piecewise function is continuous, once you ensure the left and right limits equal the function value at each boundary, you\u2019re done. Reporting a + b = 0 is sufficient.\n\nHowever, in other problems you might need to check additional things depending on what\u2019s asked:\n\n- Differentiability: If the question requires the function to be differentiable at a boundary, you must also set the left and right derivatives equal there and solve those equations (which can give extra constraints or force different parameter values).\n- Domain or function-definition issues: Sometimes a point in the interval may not be included in any piece (e.g., open intervals leaving a hole); you then must ensure the function is actually defined there or modify the definition.\n- Multiple boundary points: If there are several boundaries, you need to impose continuity at each one (as we did at x = 2 and x = \u22122).\n- Consistency checks: Occasionally the continuity equations can be contradictory (no solution) or underdetermined (infinitely many solutions); you should note that outcome if it occurs.\n- Contextual constraints: If parameters are supposed to be integers, positive, etc., you must respect those extra conditions.\n\nSo for continuity-only problems like this one, solving the continuity conditions and reporting the requested combination (a + b) is typically sufficient. If the problem asked for differentiability or had extra constraints, you\u2019d need extra steps.\n- You: Thanks \u2014 that clarifies everything for me. I see why a = \u22123 and b = 3, and why a + b = 0 is the final answer here. One quick question: if a problem did require differentiability at a boundary, would I always set the left and right derivatives equal at that point (in addition to continuity)?\n- AI Tutor: Yes \u2014 if a problem requires differentiability at a boundary point, you must have both continuity and equality of the left and right derivatives at that point. More precisely:\n\n- First ensure continuity at the point: the left-hand limit, the value at the point (if defined), and the right-hand limit must all be equal.\n- Then enforce differentiability: the left-hand derivative (limit of the difference quotient from the left) must equal the right-hand derivative (limit from the right).\n\nIn practice, for piecewise-defined functions made of simple expressions (polynomials, linear pieces, etc.), that means:\n\n- Compute the derivative formula on each side of the boundary (for x < c and x > c).\n- Evaluate each derivative at the boundary point (taking the limit as x \u2192 c from the left and right).\n- Set those two numbers equal and solve for the parameters, along with the continuity equations.\n\nExample (brief sketch): if you had\nf(x) = { ax + 3 for x > 2; x \u2212 5 for x \u2264 2 }\nthen differentiability at x = 2 would require:\n- continuity: a\u00b72 + 3 = 2 \u2212 5 (as we did), and\n- derivative equality: derivative on the right is a, derivative on the left is 1, so a = 1.\n\nNote that continuity is necessary for differentiability, but not sufficient: having equal derivatives (and both sides defined) ensures differentiability.\n\nAlso be aware of cases where derivatives don't exist (cusps, corners, vertical tangents) \u2014 then no choice of parameters can make the function differentiable there.\n- You: Thanks \u2014 that explanation cleared things up. One quick thing I want to check: when computing the left and right derivatives at the boundary, do I always take the derivative formulas for the pieces and then evaluate them at the point (i.e., take limits of the derivative expressions as x \u2192 c\u00b1), or are there cases where I need to compute the limit of the difference quotient directly instead of just plugging into the derivative expressions?\n- AI Tutor: Good question \u2014 the short answer is: usually you can take the derivative formulas for each piece and evaluate their limits at the boundary, but there are situations where you should go back to the difference quotient and compute one- or two-sided limits directly.\n\nHere\u2019s how to decide which approach to use:\n\n1) When it's safe to evaluate derivative formulas\n- If each piece is differentiable on an open interval that reaches up to (but not across) the boundary point (for example, polynomials, exponentials, trig, etc.), then you can compute the derivative on each piece by ordinary differentiation and evaluate the one-sided derivatives by taking the limit of those derivative expressions as x \u2192 c\u2212 and x \u2192 c+. For linear and polynomial pieces this is automatic and safe.\n- In practice most textbook piecewise problems use standard differentiable expressions on each side, so this shortcut works.\n\n2) When you should compute the difference quotient directly\n- If the piece is not known to be differentiable at points arbitrarily close to the boundary (e.g., it contains an absolute value, a piece that itself has a corner, or a formula defined only at isolated points), you must use the limit of the difference quotient from the appropriate side:\n  lim_{h\u21920+} [f(c+h) \u2212 f(c)]/h for the right-hand derivative,\n  lim_{h\u21920\u2212} [f(c+h) \u2212 f(c)]/h for the left-hand derivative.\n- If the derivative formula has a removable singularity or involves expressions that are undefined at the boundary but have a limit (for example rational expressions that cancel), directly computing the difference quotient may be necessary to capture cancellation before taking the limit.\n- If you suspect the derivative might not exist even though the expressions look differentiable (for instance due to oscillation, or because the function definitions change in a complicated way), use the difference-quotient definition to be sure.\n\nA helpful rule of thumb\n- If each side is given by a nice differentiable formula on an interval reaching the boundary, differentiate the piecewise formulas and evaluate at the boundary from the appropriate side.\n- If either side is nonstandard, nondifferentiable, or involves potential cancellation/undefined expressions at the boundary, compute the one-sided difference quotients.\n\nWould you like to try a short example where using the derivative formulas works, and one where you must use the difference quotient? I can guide you through either.\n- You: Thanks \u2014 that clarification helped. One quick thing I'm unsure about: when evaluating the derivative formulas at the boundary, you said to take the limit of the derivative expressions as x \u2192 c\u00b1. Is that ever different from simply plugging x = c into each derivative formula (for example if the derivative formula itself is undefined at c but has a limit)? In other words, should I always think in terms of limits rather than direct substitution to be safe?\n- AI Tutor: Good question \u2014 thinking in terms of one-sided limits is the safer, more precise habit. Here\u2019s why, and how to apply it.\n\n- If each piece is defined and differentiable on an open interval that includes points arbitrarily close to the boundary (but possibly not the boundary itself), then the one-sided derivative equals the limit of the derivative expression as x \u2192 c\u00b1. In that common case the derivative expression is continuous at the boundary and simply plugging x = c into the derivative formula gives the same result as taking the limit.\n\n- However, there are cases where the derivative expression is undefined at c (or has a removable singularity) even though the one-sided derivative exists. In those cases direct substitution into the derivative formula could fail or be misleading, while taking the limit of the derivative expression (or better yet, taking the difference-quotient limit) gives the correct one-sided derivative.\n\nSo yes \u2014 think in terms of limits to be safe. Concretely:\n\n- Preferred quick method (safe when each piece is nice): differentiate each piece algebraically, then compute the one-sided derivatives by evaluating the derivative expressions at x = c (i.e., take the limit of the derivative as x \u2192 c\u00b1). If those expressions are defined and continuous at c, substitution is fine.\n\n- Safer, always-correct method: compute the one-sided derivative directly from the definition\n  left derivative = lim_{h\u21920\u2212} [f(c+h) \u2212 f(c)]/h,\n  right derivative = lim_{h\u21920+} [f(c+h) \u2212 f(c)]/h.\n  This handles removable singularities and other edge cases.\n\nExample situations where limits matter:\n- A derivative expression has a factor that cancels with something in the difference quotient, producing a finite limit even though the raw derivative formula is undefined at c.\n- A piece includes an absolute value or other nondifferentiable expression near c \u2014 then you should use the one-sided difference quotient to detect a corner.\n\nIn summary: using the derivative formulas and plugging in x = c is fine for \u201cnice\u201d pieces (polynomials, exponentials, etc.). To be rigorous in all cases, think and compute in terms of one-sided limits (or use the difference-quotient definition when in doubt). Would you like to try a small example that demonstrates a removable singularity where substitution would fail but the limit approach works?\n- You: Thanks \u2014 that clears up the limits vs substitution issue for me. One quick question to make sure I understand: if I needed differentiability at x = 2 for our original piecewise function, I'd (1) enforce the continuity equations we already used, and then (2) set the left-hand derivative at 2 equal to the right-hand derivative at 2. For the left derivative I'd use the derivative of the left piece evaluated as x \u2192 2\u2212 (or compute lim_{h\u21920\u2212} [f(2+h)-f(2)]/h), and similarly for the right side. Is that correct? Also, in typical textbook problems with polynomials and linear pieces, is it safe to just compute the derivative formulas and plug x = 2 (i.e., the usual shortcut)?\n- AI Tutor: Yes \u2014 that's exactly right.\n\nSteps for requiring differentiability at x = 2:\n1) Enforce continuity at x = 2 (so the left and right limits equal the value at 2).\n2) Enforce equality of one-sided derivatives at x = 2:\n   - Left-hand derivative = lim_{x\u21922\u2212} f'(x) for the left piece (or compute lim_{h\u21920\u2212} [f(2+h) \u2212 f(2)]/h).\n   - Right-hand derivative = lim_{x\u21922+} f'(x) for the right piece (or compute lim_{h\u21920+} [f(2+h) \u2212 f(2)]/h).\n   - Set these equal and solve (together with the continuity condition(s)).\n\nAnd yes \u2014 for typical textbook piecewise problems where each piece is a polynomial or linear function (or other \u201cnice\u201d differentiable expression) defined on an interval reaching up to the boundary, the usual shortcut is safe: differentiate each piece normally and plug x = 2 into each derivative expression to get the one-sided derivatives. If those derivative expressions are defined and continuous at 2, their values at 2 equal the one-sided derivative limits. Use the difference-quotient definition only when a piece is not known to be differentiable near the boundary or you suspect removable singularities or other edge cases.\n- You: Thanks \u2014 that helps a lot. One quick question to make sure I'm using the safer habit: when a piece is a polynomial or linear (so \"nice\"), is it still good practice to mentally note \"one-sided limit\" even if I just plug in x = 2 into the derivative formulas? In other words, should I always think in terms of the one-sided derivative limits (even when I substitute) so I don't forget edge cases?\n- AI Tutor: Yes \u2014 that's a good habit. Even when you use the shortcut of differentiating and substituting, mentally phrasing it as \u201cthe one-sided derivative limit from the left/right\u201d keeps you precise and makes you less likely to miss edge cases.\n\nConcretely:\n- For a \u201cnice\u201d piece (polynomial, linear, etc.) it\u2019s fine to compute f\u2032(x) on that piece and substitute x = c to get the one-sided derivative value. But while doing so, think: \u201cthis is the limit of f\u2032(x) as x \u2192 c\u2212 (or c+)\u201d or equivalently \u201cthis equals lim_{h\u21920\u00b1}[f(c+h)\u2212f(c)]/h.\u201d That mental step reminds you that you\u2019re computing a one-sided limit and that continuity (and differentiability on the open side) matters.\n- If anything in the piece could make the derivative expression fail at c (absolute value, division by zero, oscillation, piece not defined arbitrarily close to c, etc.), switch to explicitly computing the appropriate one-sided difference-quotient limit instead of blind substitution.\n\nSo yes \u2014 treat substitution as shorthand for taking the one-sided derivative limits, and use the difference quotient whenever you have the slightest doubt. That way your reasoning stays correct and rigorous even in tricky cases. Would you like a very quick example to practice this habit?\n- You: Thanks \u2014 that explanation about thinking in terms of one-sided limits even when substituting was helpful and makes sense. Quick question: when a piece is a polynomial (so its derivative formula is continuous up to the boundary), is it enough to simply compute f\u2032 for that piece and plug in x = c while mentally noting it's the one-sided limit, or should I still write lim_{x\u2192c\u00b1} f\u2032(x) each time in formal solutions? Which approach do graders usually prefer in calculus problems?\n- AI Tutor: Good question \u2014 this is about balancing rigor with economy in written solutions.\n\n- For submission-quality answers in most calculus courses and standard exams, it is perfectly acceptable to compute f\u2032 on each piece and then write f\u2032(c\u2212) = (value) and f\u2032(c+) = (value), or simply evaluate the derivative expressions at x = c (e.g., f\u2032_left(c) = ... and f\u2032_right(c) = ...). Implicitly you\u2019re using the one-sided limit idea; graders expect this shorthand when the pieces are \"nice\" (polynomials, exponentials, etc.).\n\n- If you want to be slightly more explicit (and that\u2019s often appreciated), you can annotate with a short phrase such as \u201cone-sided derivative\u201d or \u201climit from the right/left.\u201d Examples:\n  - \u201cf\u2032_-(2) = lim_{x\u21922\u2212} f\u2032_left(x) = \u2026\u201d or\n  - \u201cRight-hand derivative: f\u2032_+(2) = \u2026; Left-hand derivative: f\u2032_-(2) = \u2026.\u201d\n  This communicates rigor without doing the full difference-quotient computation.\n\n- When you must be fully rigorous (e.g., a proof-based course, or when the piece has singularities or nondifferentiable features), you should use the difference-quotient definition:\n  lim_{h\u21920+} [f(c+h) \u2212 f(c)]/h and lim_{h\u21920\u2212} [f(c+h) \u2212 f(c)]/h.\n\nWhat graders usually prefer\n- For routine textbook/calculus problems with smooth pieces: the concise method (differentiate each piece and evaluate at the boundary, with a brief note that these are one-sided derivatives) is fine and common.\n- If the problem or instructor emphasizes rigor, show the one-sided limit notation or the difference-quotient form \u2014 especially if there is any chance of ambiguity.\n\nSo, practice the habit of thinking \u201cone-sided limits,\u201d and in written answers either (a) use the concise derivative-evaluate shorthand and name them one-sided derivatives, or (b) write the one-sided limit expressions when you want to be fully explicit. Both are acceptable; choose based on the course expectations and the complexity of the pieces.\n- You: Thanks \u2014 that cleared up my confusion about substitution vs. limits. Quick question: when I write a short answer on a midterm (not a proof class), is this phrasing safe and concise enough?\n\n\u201cCompute f\u2032 on each piece and evaluate at x = 2 to get the one-sided derivatives f\u2032_-(2) and f\u2032_+(2); set them equal.\u201d\n\nOr should I add a parenthetical like \u201c(interpreted as one-sided limits)\u201d to be safe? Which of those two would graders usually prefer?\n- AI Tutor: Both phrasings are fine for a typical midterm in a standard calculus course. Graders usually expect the concise form, and they understand that \u201cevaluate at x = 2\u201d for piecewise pieces means you are taking one-sided derivatives. Which to use depends on how picky the instructor is:\n\n- Short, safe, and usually sufficient:\n  \u201cCompute f\u2032 on each piece and evaluate at x = 2 to get the one-sided derivatives f\u2032_-(2) and f\u2032_+(2); set them equal.\u201d\n\n- Slightly more explicit (if you want to be extra careful):\n  \u201cCompute f\u2032 on each piece and evaluate at x = 2 to get the one-sided derivatives f\u2032_-(2) and f\u2032_+(2) (interpreted as one-sided limits); set them equal.\u201d\n\nIf you know your instructor/TA is strict about rigor, include the parenthetical. Otherwise the shorter version is perfectly acceptable and shows you know what you\u2019re doing. Which would you prefer to use on your next exam?\n- You: Thanks \u2014 that makes sense. I\u2019ll use the concise phrasing on most midterms and add \u201c(interpreted as one-sided limits)\u201d when the instructor is strict. One quick follow-up: if I include the parenthetical, is it better to write it right after \u201cone-sided derivatives\u201d or at the end of the sentence?\n- AI Tutor: Either placement works, but putting the parenthetical right after \u201cone-sided derivatives\u201d is slightly clearer and more direct. That way the reader immediately knows how you interpret those symbols. For example:\n\n\u201cCompute f\u2032 on each piece and evaluate at x = 2 to get the one-sided derivatives f\u2032_-(2) and f\u2032_+(2) (interpreted as one-sided limits); set them equal.\u201d\n\nPlacing it at the end of the sentence is also acceptable, but might force the reader to finish the sentence before seeing the clarification. So prefer the first placement for clarity.\n- You: I\u2019ll put the parenthetical right after \u201cone-sided derivatives\u201d for clarity. Quick question: for a moderately strict grader, is the shorthand f\u2032_-(c) and f\u2032_+(c) (with the parenthetical) sufficient, or should I write the explicit one-sided limit notation lim_{x\u2192c\u00b1} f\u2032(x) to be safe?\n- AI Tutor: For a moderately strict grader, the shorthand f\u2032_-(c) and f\u2032_+(c) together with the parenthetical clarification is usually sufficient. It shows you know you mean one-sided derivatives and that you\u2019re not confusing two-sided differentiability with simply evaluating a derivative across a jump.\n\nIf you want to be extra safe (or if the grader is known to be very pedantic), write one of these slightly more explicit forms:\n\n- f\u2032_-(c) = lim_{x\u2192c\u2212} f\u2032(x) and f\u2032_+(c) = lim_{x\u2192c+} f\u2032(x)  \u2014 concise and clear; or\n- f\u2032_-(c) = lim_{h\u21920\u2212} [f(c+h) \u2212 f(c)]/h and f\u2032_+(c) = lim_{h\u21920+} [f(c+h) \u2212 f(c)]/h  \u2014 fully rigorous from first principles.\n\nRecommendation:\n- On most midterms: use f\u2032_-(c) and f\u2032_+(c) with the parenthetical \u201c(interpreted as one-sided limits)\u201d.\n- If you know the grader is strict or the function has potential issues (absolute values, divisions by zero, removable singularities), either write the lim_{x\u2192c\u00b1} f\u2032(x) form or the difference-quotient limits.\n\nEither choice will be accepted by a moderately strict grader; reserve the difference-quotient form for when you need to show actual limit work.\n\n# Your Message Style\n## Interaction Style\n- Length of User Message: The user's query/response is always around 20 words.\n\n# Task\nGenerate your next message following these rules:\n1.
