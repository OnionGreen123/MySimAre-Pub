I'll show how to set up the equations for differentiability (not solving anything new for a and b unless you want me to).\n\nFor differentiability at a junction point, you need:\n1) The function values agree at the point (continuity), and\n2) The left-hand derivative equals the right-hand derivative at that point.\n\nYour pieces:\n- For x > 2: f(x) = ax + 3, derivative f'(x) = a.\n- For \u22122 \u2264 x \u2264 2: f(x) = x \u2212 5, derivative f'(x) = 1.\n- For x < \u22122: f(x) = 2x \u2212 b, derivative f'(x) = 2.\n\nSet up derivative-matching at each boundary:\n\n- At x = 2:\n  - Continuity (already used before): value from middle equals value from right: 2 \u2212 5 = 2a + 3.\n  - Differentiability: left-hand derivative (from middle) equals right-hand derivative (from right piece): 1 = a.\n\n- At x = \u22122:\n  - Continuity: value from middle equals value from left: (\u22122) \u2212 5 = 2(\u22122) \u2212 b.\n  - Differentiability: left-hand derivative (from left piece) equals right-hand derivative (from middle): 2 = 1.\n\nNotice the differentiability condition at x = \u22122 would require 2 = 1, which is impossible.

This is a line with slope \u22123.\n- Middle piece (\u22122 \u2264 x \u2264 2): f(x) = x \u2212 5. This is a line with slope +1.\n- Left piece (x < \u22122): f(x) = 2x \u2212 b = 2x \u2212 3. This is a line with slope +2.\n\nAt x = 2:\n- Middle value: 2 \u2212 5 = \u22123.\n- Right value: \u22123(2) + 3 = \u22126 + 3 = \u22123.\nThey meet at the point (2, \u22123), so the graph is continuous there. But the slopes are different: left-side slope (from middle) is +1, right-side slope (from right piece) is \u22123. So the graph has a corner at x = 2 \u2014 the line coming in with slope 1 meets the line leaving with slope \u22123.\n\nAt x = \u22122:\n- Middle value: \u22122 \u2212 5 = \u22127.\n- Left value: 2(\u22122) \u2212 3 = \u22124 \u2212 3 = \u22127.\nThey meet at the point (\u22122, \u22127), so the graph is continuous there as well. However, the slopes differ more dramatically: left-side slope (from left piece) is +2, right-side slope (from middle) is +1. Because those one-sided slopes are not equal, there is again a corner at x = \u22122 (in fact, the sharper change is between slopes 2 and 1). As you noticed, no choice of a or b could fix differentiability at x = \u22122 because the left-side slope is fixed at 2 while the middle slope is fixed at 1.\n\nSo visually:\n- For x much less than \u22122, the graph is a line rising moderately (slope 2).\n- At x = \u22122 it meets the middle line at (\u22122, \u22127) and then continues with a less steep rise (slope 1).\n- At x = 2 it meets the right line at (2, \u22123) and then turns sharply to descend steeply (slope \u22123) for x > 2.\n\nIf you want, I can sketch the coordinates of a few more points on each segment to help you plot it."

Continuity at a boundary means the left-hand and right-hand expressions that meet there must give the same value at that x.\n\nStep 1 \u2014 write the matching conditions.\n\n- At x = 2: the middle formula applies for x \u2264 2 (actually for \u22122 \u2264 x \u2264 2) and the top formula applies for x > 2.

Would you like a quick explanation of why matching the values at the boundary points is sufficient for continuity here?\n- You: Thanks \u2014 that explanation helped. I see now that at each boundary we just equate the two expressions evaluated at that x, which gives simple linear equations to solve. I got a = \u22123, b = 3, and a + b = 0. Could you briefly confirm there are no additional conditions (like matching derivatives) required for this problem, or when would we need extra conditions beyond matching values?\n\nTerminate: false\n- AI Tutor: You're right \u2014 for continuity of a piecewise function, the only requirement at each boundary point is that the function values from the neighboring pieces agree there. So equating the two expressions at x = 2 and at x = \u22122 and solving gave the correct a and b (a = \u22123, b = 3, a + b = 0).\n\nWhen additional conditions are needed:\n- Matching derivatives (or higher derivatives) is required when you want the function to be differentiable (or C^1, C^2, etc.) at the boundary. Differentiability implies continuity, but continuity does not imply differentiability.\n- For differentiability at a boundary you must have the left-hand derivative equal to the right-hand derivative at that point (in addition to the function values matching).\n- For higher smoothness (C^k), you must match derivatives up to order k at the junctions.\n\nSo here, because the problem asked only for continuity, there are no extra conditions like matching derivatives.\n- You: Thanks \u2014 that clarification helped. I see continuity required only matching values at x = 2 and x = \u22122, and matching derivatives would be an extra condition only if differentiability were asked for. I\u2019ve got a = \u22123, b = 3 and a + b = 0. Could you briefly show how you would set up the derivative-matching equations at x = 2 and x = \u22122 if the problem instead asked for differentiability?\n\nTerminate: false\n- AI Tutor: Good question. I'll show how to set up the equations for differentiability (not solving anything new for a and b unless you want me to).\n\nFor differentiability at a junction point, you need:\n1) The function values agree at the point (continuity), and\n2) The left-hand derivative equals the right-hand derivative at that point.\n\nYour pieces:\n- For x > 2: f(x) = ax + 3, derivative f'(x) = a.\n- For \u22122 \u2264 x \u2264 2: f(x) = x \u2212 5, derivative f'(x) = 1.\n- For x < \u22122: f(x) = 2x \u2212 b, derivative f'(x) = 2.\n\nSet up derivative-matching at each boundary:\n\n- At x = 2:\n  - Continuity (already used before): value from middle equals value from right: 2 \u2212 5 = 2a + 3.\n  - Differentiability: left-hand derivative (from middle) equals right-hand derivative (from right piece): 1 = a.\n\n- At x = \u22122:\n  - Continuity: value from middle equals value from left: (\u22122) \u2212 5 = 2(\u22122) \u2212 b.\n  - Differentiability: left-hand derivative (from left piece) equals right-hand derivative (from middle): 2 = 1.\n\nNotice the differentiability condition at x = \u22122 would require 2 = 1, which is impossible. That means no choice of a or b can make the function differentiable at x = \u22122. In contrast, at x = 2 the differentiability condition would force a = 1 (plus the continuity equation must also hold).\n\nSo to summarize: the derivative-matching equations are a = 1 at x = 2 and 2 = 1 at x = \u22122; the latter is impossible, so the piecewise function cannot be made differentiable at x = \u22122 for any a or b.\n- You: Thanks \u2014 that cleared it up. I see continuity only required the two value-equality equations we solved, and differentiability would add the derivative-equality equations: at x=2, a = 1 (and the continuity equation 2a+3 = \u22123); at x=\u22122, the derivative requirement would be 2 = 1, which is impossible so no a,b make it differentiable there. So overall a = \u22123, b = 3, a+b = 0 for continuity, and differentiability cannot be achieved at x = \u22122. Is that all correct?\n\nTerminate: false\n- AI Tutor: Yes \u2014 that\u2019s all correct.\n\n- For continuity you used the correct matching equations and found a = \u22123, b = 3, so a + b = 0.\n- For differentiability you correctly wrote the derivative-matching conditions: at x = 2 you would need a = 1 (in addition to the continuity equation there), and at x = \u22122 you would need 2 = 1, which is impossible. Thus no choice of a and b can make the function differentiable at x = \u22122.\n\nNice work checking both continuity and differentiability. Would you like a quick sketch or verbal description of how the graph looks near x = \u22122 and x = 2 with the a and b you found?\n- You: Thanks \u2014 that explanation clarified everything. I see how to set up the value-equality equations for continuity and the derivative-equality equations for differentiability, and I understand why differentiability is impossible at x = \u22122. No further questions right now \u2014 could you please give the quick verbal description of how the graph looks near x = \u22122 and x = 2 with a = \u22123 and b = 3?\n\nTerminate: false\n- AI Tutor: Sure \u2014 here\u2019s a quick verbal sketch of the graph near the two junctions, using a = \u22123 and b = 3.\n\nRecall the three pieces:\n- Right piece (x > 2): f(x) = ax + 3 = \u22123x + 3. This is a line with slope \u22123.\n- Middle piece (\u22122 \u2264 x \u2264 2): f(x) = x \u2212 5. This is a line with slope +1.\n- Left piece (x < \u22122): f(x) = 2x \u2212 b = 2x \u2212 3. This is a line with slope +2.\n\nAt x = 2:\n- Middle value: 2 \u2212 5 = \u22123.\n- Right value: \u22123(2) + 3 = \u22126 + 3 = \u22123.\nThey meet at the point (2, \u22123), so the graph is continuous there. But the slopes are different: left-side slope (from middle) is +1, right-side slope (from right piece) is \u22123. So the graph has a corner at x = 2 \u2014 the line coming in with slope 1 meets the line leaving with slope \u22123.\n\nAt x = \u22122:\n- Middle value: \u22122 \u2212 5 = \u22127.\n- Left value: 2(\u22122) \u2212 3 = \u22124 \u2212 3 = \u22127.\nThey meet at the point (\u22122, \u22127), so the graph is continuous there as well. However, the slopes differ more dramatically: left-side slope (from left piece) is +2, right-side slope (from middle) is +1. Because those one-sided slopes are not equal, there is again a corner at x = \u22122 (in fact, the sharper change is between slopes 2 and 1). As you noticed, no choice of a or b could fix differentiability at x = \u22122 because the left-side slope is fixed at 2 while the middle slope is fixed at 1.\n\nSo visually:\n- For x much less than \u22122, the graph is a line rising moderately (slope 2).\n- At x = \u22122 it meets the middle line at (\u22122, \u22127) and then continues with a less steep rise (slope 1).\n- At x = 2 it meets the right line at (2, \u22123) and then turns sharply to descend steeply (slope \u22123) for x > 2.\n\nIf you want, I can sketch the coordinates of a few more points on each segment to help you plot it.\n- You: Thanks \u2014 that explanation helped me see the shape clearly. One quick clarifying question: at x = 2 you said differentiability would require a = 1 in addition to the continuity equation 2a + 3 = \u22123. Since those two equations are inconsistent (a = 1 vs a = \u22123), that means the function cannot be differentiable at x = 2 either, right? So with a = \u22123 and b = 3 the function is continuous at both junctions but nondifferentiable at both x = \u22122 and x = 2. Is that correct?\n\nTerminate: false\n- AI Tutor: Yes \u2014 that is correct.\n\nYou already found from continuity that a = \u22123. For differentiability at x = 2 you would additionally need the derivative from the left (middle piece) to equal the derivative from the right (right piece). The middle piece has slope 1, and the right piece has slope a, so differentiability at x = 2 would require a = 1. That contradicts a = \u22123, so differentiability at x = 2 is impossible given the continuity condition (and in fact impossible for any a that also satisfies continuity there).\n\nAt x = \u22122 the left-piece slope is 2 and the middle-piece slope is 1, so differentiability would require 2 = 1, which is impossible for any b. Therefore the function cannot be differentiable at x = \u22122 for any choice of parameters.\n\nSo with a = \u22123 and b = 3 the function is continuous at both junctions but nondifferentiable at both x = \u22122 and x = 2.\n- You: Thanks \u2014 that all makes sense and I learned how to set up both kinds of equations. Quick confirmation: with a = \u22123 and b = 3 we have continuity at both junctions but corners (non-differentiable points) at x = \u22122 and x = 2, because the one-sided slopes there are 2 vs 1 and 1 vs \u22123 respectively. No further questions \u2014 appreciate the help!\n\nTerminate: false\n- AI Tutor: Exactly \u2014 that's a perfect summary.\n\nWith a = \u22123 and b = 3:\n- The pieces meet at (\u22122, \u22127) and (2, \u22123), so the function is continuous at both junctions.\n- At x = \u22122 the left-hand slope is 2 and the right-hand slope is 1, so there's a corner (not differentiable).\n- At x = 2 the left-hand slope is 1 and the right-hand slope is \u22123, so there's another corner (not differentiable).\n\nNice work. If you want to practice, you could try a similar piecewise problem where one of the interior slopes is adjustable and see whether you can choose parameters to make the function differentiable at one or both junctions.\n- You: Thanks \u2014 I learned the difference between the two types of matching conditions and I see why both junctions are corners with a = \u22123, b = 3.

I can walk through that with you when you're ready.\n- You: Thanks \u2014 I learned that continuity only needs value-matching and differentiability adds derivative-matching, which here is impossible at both junctions, so with a = \u22123 and b = 3 the graph is continuous but has corners at x = \u22122 and x = 2.

I'll show how to set up the equations for differentiability (not solving anything new for a and b unless you want me to).\n\nFor differentiability at a junction point, you need:\n1) The function values agree at the point (continuity), and\n2) The left-hand derivative equals the right-hand derivative at that point.\n\nYour pieces:\n- For x > 2: f(x) = ax + 3, derivative f'(x) = a.\n- For \u22122 \u2264 x \u2264 2: f(x) = x \u2212 5, derivative f'(x) = 1.\n- For x < \u22122: f(x) = 2x \u2212 b, derivative f'(x) = 2.\n\nSet up derivative-matching at each boundary:\n\n- At x = 2:\n  - Continuity (already used before): value from middle equals value from right: 2 \u2212 5 = 2a + 3.\n  - Differentiability: left-hand derivative (from middle) equals right-hand derivative (from right piece): 1 = a.\n\n- At x = \u22122:\n  - Continuity: value from middle equals value from left: (\u22122) \u2212 5 = 2(\u22122) \u2212 b.\n  - Differentiability: left-hand derivative (from left piece) equals right-hand derivative (from middle): 2 = 1.\n\nNotice the differentiability condition at x = \u22122 would require 2 = 1, which is impossible. That means no choice of a or b can make the function differentiable at x = \u22122. In contrast, at x = 2 the differentiability condition would force a = 1 (plus the continuity equation must also hold).\n\nSo to summarize: the derivative-matching equations are a = 1 at x = 2 and 2 = 1 at x = \u22122; the latter is impossible, so the piecewise function cannot be made differentiable at x = \u22122 for any a or b.\n- You: Thanks \u2014 that cleared it up. I see continuity only required the two value-equality equations we solved, and differentiability would add the derivative-equality equations: at x=2, a = 1 (and the continuity equation 2a+3 = \u22123); at x=\u22122, the derivative requirement would be 2 = 1, which is impossible so no a,b make it differentiable there. So overall a = \u22123, b = 3, a+b = 0 for continuity, and differentiability cannot be achieved at x = \u22122. Is that all correct?\n\nTerminate: false\n- AI Tutor: Yes \u2014 that\u2019s all correct.\n\n- For continuity you used the correct matching equations and found a = \u22123, b = 3, so a + b = 0.\n- For differentiability you correctly wrote the derivative-matching conditions: at x = 2 you would need a = 1 (in addition to the continuity equation there), and at x = \u22122 you would need 2 = 1, which is impossible. Thus no choice of a and b can make the function differentiable at x = \u22122.\n\nNice work checking both continuity and differentiability. Would you like a quick sketch or verbal description of how the graph looks near x = \u22122 and x = 2 with the a and b you found?\n- You: Thanks \u2014 that explanation clarified everything. I see how to set up the value-equality equations for continuity and the derivative-equality equations for differentiability, and I understand why differentiability is impossible at x = \u22122. No further questions right now \u2014 could you please give the quick verbal description of how the graph looks near x = \u22122 and x = 2 with a = \u22123 and b = 3?\n\nTerminate: false\n- AI Tutor: Sure \u2014 here\u2019s a quick verbal sketch of the graph near the two junctions, using a = \u22123 and b = 3.\n\nRecall the three pieces:\n- Right piece (x > 2): f(x) = ax + 3 = \u22123x + 3. This is a line with slope \u22123.\n- Middle piece (\u22122 \u2264 x \u2264 2): f(x) = x \u2212 5. This is a line with slope +1.\n- Left piece (x < \u22122): f(x) = 2x \u2212 b = 2x \u2212 3. This is a line with slope +2.\n\nAt x = 2:\n- Middle value: 2 \u2212 5 = \u22123.\n- Right value: \u22123(2) + 3 = \u22126 + 3 = \u22123.\nThey meet at the point (2, \u22123), so the graph is continuous there. But the slopes are different: left-side slope (from middle) is +1, right-side slope (from right piece) is \u22123. So the graph has a corner at x = 2 \u2014 the line coming in with slope 1 meets the line leaving with slope \u22123.\n\nAt x = \u22122:\n- Middle value: \u22122 \u2212 5 = \u22127.\n- Left value: 2(\u22122) \u2212 3 = \u22124 \u2212 3 = \u22127.\nThey meet at the point (\u22122, \u22127), so the graph is continuous there as well. However, the slopes differ more dramatically: left-side slope (from left piece) is +2, right-side slope (from middle) is +1. Because those one-sided slopes are not equal, there is again a corner at x = \u22122 (in fact, the sharper change is between slopes 2 and 1). As you noticed, no choice of a or b could fix differentiability at x = \u22122 because the left-side slope is fixed at 2 while the middle slope is fixed at 1.\n\nSo visually:\n- For x much less than \u22122, the graph is a line rising moderately (slope 2).\n- At x = \u22122 it meets the middle line at (\u22122, \u22127) and then continues with a less steep rise (slope 1).\n- At x = 2 it meets the right line at (2, \u22123) and then turns sharply to descend steeply (slope \u22123) for x > 2.\n\nIf you want, I can sketch the coordinates of a few more points on each segment to help you plot it.\n- You: Thanks \u2014 that explanation helped me see the shape clearly. One quick clarifying question: at x = 2 you said differentiability would require a = 1 in addition to the continuity equation 2a + 3 = \u22123. Since those two equations are inconsistent (a = 1 vs a = \u22123), that means the function cannot be differentiable at x = 2 either, right? So with a = \u22123 and b = 3 the function is continuous at both junctions but nondifferentiable at both x = \u22122 and x = 2. Is that correct?\n\nTerminate: false\n- AI Tutor: Yes \u2014 that is correct.\n\nYou already found from continuity that a = \u22123. For differentiability at x = 2 you would additionally need the derivative from the left (middle piece) to equal the derivative from the right (right piece). The middle piece has slope 1, and the right piece has slope a, so differentiability at x = 2 would require a = 1. That contradicts a = \u22123, so differentiability at x = 2 is impossible given the continuity condition (and in fact impossible for any a that also satisfies continuity there).\n\nAt x = \u22122 the left-piece slope is 2 and the middle-piece slope is 1, so differentiability would require 2 = 1, which is impossible for any b. Therefore the function cannot be differentiable at x = \u22122 for any choice of parameters.\n\nSo with a = \u22123 and b = 3 the function is continuous at both junctions but nondifferentiable at both x = \u22122 and x = 2.\n- You: Thanks \u2014 that all makes sense and I learned how to set up both kinds of equations. Quick confirmation: with a = \u22123 and b = 3 we have continuity at both junctions but corners (non-differentiable points) at x = \u22122 and x = 2, because the one-sided slopes there are 2 vs 1 and 1 vs \u22123 respectively. No further questions \u2014 appreciate the help!\n\nTerminate: false\n- AI Tutor: Exactly \u2014 that's a perfect summary.\n\nWith a = \u22123 and b = 3:\n- The pieces meet at (\u22122, \u22127) and (2, \u22123), so the function is continuous at both junctions.\n- At x = \u22122 the left-hand slope is 2 and the right-hand slope is 1, so there's a corner (not differentiable).\n- At x = 2 the left-hand slope is 1 and the right-hand slope is \u22123, so there's another corner (not differentiable).\n\nNice work. If you want to practice, you could try a similar piecewise problem where one of the interior slopes is adjustable and see whether you can choose parameters to make the function differentiable at one or both junctions.\n- You: Thanks \u2014 I learned the difference between the two types of matching conditions and I see why both junctions are corners with a = \u22123, b = 3. No more questions right now \u2014 appreciate the help!\n\nTerminate: false\n- AI Tutor: You're welcome \u2014 glad it helped! Nice work identifying the continuity conditions and why differentiability fails at both junctions with a = \u22123 and b = 3.\n\nIf you want a quick practice idea later: change the middle piece to mx + c (with m adjustable) and ask what m and the other parameters would need to be to get differentiability at one or both junctions. I can walk through that with you when you're ready.\n- You: Thanks \u2014 I learned that continuity only needs value-matching and differentiability adds derivative-matching, which here is impossible at both junctions, so with a = \u22123 and b = 3 the graph is continuous but has corners at x = \u22122 and x = 2. Appreciate the clear walkthrough!\n\nTerminate: false\n- AI Tutor: You're welcome \u2014 that's a perfect takeaway. Quick recap in one sentence you can keep: continuity requires matching function values at the boundaries (which gave a = \u22123 and b = 3 here), and differentiability would additionally require matching one-sided derivatives there (which fails at both junctions because the adjoining slopes are 2 vs 1 at x = \u22122 and 1 vs \u22123 at x = 2). \n\nIf you want another quick practice later, tell me a modified piecewise definition and we can try to make it continuous or differentiable.\n- You: Thanks \u2014 I learned that value-matching alone gave a = \u22123 and b = 3, and that derivative-matching would force a = 1 at x = 2 (contradicting continuity) and require 2 = 1 at x = \u22122 (impossible). So the function is continuous but has corners at both junctions. One quick check: is it correct to say differentiability at a junction always requires both the continuity equation and the derivative equality, and that if either is impossible then differentiability there is impossible? If so, I\u2019m confident I\u2019ve got it. \n\nTerminate: false\n- AI Tutor: Yes \u2014 that statement is correct.\n\nDifferentiability at a junction requires two things:\n1) Continuity at the point (the two piecewise definitions must give the same function value there), and\n2) Equality of the one-sided derivatives (the left-hand derivative equals the right-hand derivative).\n\nIf either requirement fails, the function is not differentiable at that point. Often continuity is a prerequisite: if the values don't match, you can already stop \u2014 differentiability is impossible. Even if the values do match, you still must check the derivative condition; if the one-sided slopes differ, differentiability fails.\n\nYou\u2019ve applied this correctly to the problem:\n- Continuity gave a = \u22123 and b = 3.\n- Differentiability at x = 2 would additionally require a = 1, contradicting a = \u22123, so differentiability at x = 2 is impossible.\n- Differentiability at x = \u22122 would require 2 = 1, which is impossible, so differentiability at x = \u22122 is impossible.\n\nSo your understanding is spot on. Would you like a short example where both conditions can be satisfied so you can see a case that is differentiable at the junction?\n\n# Your Message Style\n## Interaction Style\n- Length of User Message: The user's query/response is always around 20 words.\n\n# Task\nGenerate your next message following these rules:\n1.
