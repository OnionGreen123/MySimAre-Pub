Continuity at each boundary means the left-hand limit and the right-hand limit (or the function values from the adjacent pieces) are equal to the value of the function at that point.\n\nStep through each boundary:\n\n1) At x = 2:\n- The definition for \u22122 \u2264 x \u2264 2 gives the function value at x = 2: f(2) = 2 \u2212 5 = \u22123.\n- For x > 2 the formula is ax + 3, so the right-hand value as x \u2192 2+ is a(2) + 3.\nContinuity at x = 2 requires the right-hand value to equal f(2). Write that equation.\n\n2) At x = \u22122:\n- The middle piece gives f(\u22122) = (\u22122) \u2212 5 = \u22127.\n- For x < \u22122 the formula is 2x \u2212 b, so the left-hand value as x \u2192 \u22122\u2212 is 2(\u22122) \u2212 b.\nContinuity at x = \u22122 requires the left-hand value to equal f(\u22122).

I can compute the middle piece at those x-values, but I'm not sure which expressions to equate to those numbers.\n- AI Tutor: Good \u2014 you already know to check x = 2 and x = \u22122 because those are the boundary points where the formula changes. Continuity at each boundary means the left-hand limit and the right-hand limit (or the function values from the adjacent pieces) are equal to the value of the function at that point.\n\nStep through each boundary:\n\n1) At x = 2:\n- The definition for \u22122 \u2264 x \u2264 2 gives the function value at x = 2: f(2) = 2 \u2212 5 = \u22123.\n- For x > 2 the formula is ax + 3, so the right-hand value as x \u2192 2+ is a(2) + 3.\nContinuity at x = 2 requires the right-hand value to equal f(2). Write that equation.\n\n2) At x = \u22122:\n- The middle piece gives f(\u22122) = (\u22122) \u2212 5 = \u22127.\n- For x < \u22122 the formula is 2x \u2212 b, so the left-hand value as x \u2192 \u22122\u2212 is 2(\u22122) \u2212 b.\nContinuity at x = \u22122 requires the left-hand value to equal f(\u22122). Write that equation.\n\nSo the two equations you should write are:\n- a(2) + 3 = \u22123\n- 2(\u22122) \u2212 b = \u22127\n\nNow solve those two simple equations for a and b, then compute a + b. Try solving them and tell me what you get. If you want, I can check your arithmetic.\n- You: I get the two equations a(2) + 3 = \u22123 and 2(\u22122) \u2212 b = \u22127. Can you show the algebra steps to solve each of these for a and b? I can do the arithmetic once I see the isolating steps.\n- AI Tutor: Good \u2014 you set up the correct equations. I'll show the algebraic steps to isolate a and b without doing the final arithmetic for you.\n\n1) Solve 2a + 3 = \u22123 for a:\n- Subtract 3 from both sides: 2a = \u22123 \u2212 3.\n- Divide both sides by 2: a = (\u22123 \u2212 3)/2.\n\n2) Solve 2(\u22122) \u2212 b = \u22127 for b:\n- First compute 2(\u22122): that gives \u22124, so the equation is \u22124 \u2212 b = \u22127.\n- Add 4 to both sides: \u2212b = \u22127 + 4.\n- Multiply both sides by \u22121: b = \u2212(\u22127 + 4).\n\nNow compute the arithmetic in those expressions for a and b, then add them to get a + b.
