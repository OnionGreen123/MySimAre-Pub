\\right.\\]Find $a+b$ if the piecewise function is continuous (which means that its graph can be drawn without lifting your pencil from the paper).</div><div class="meta">Problem ID: 0</div><div class="turn user"><div class="role">user</div><div class="content">Thought: I understand the piecewise definition and that continuity means no jumps at the boundaries x = -2 and x = 2. I can evaluate the middle piece at those points, but I&#x27;m unsure how to use those values to find a and b or how to set the expressions equal at the boundaries.

Query: At x = 2 and x = -2, how do I use the left and right pieces to write equations that ensure continuity? I can compute the middle piece at those x-values, but I&#x27;m not sure which expressions to equate to those numbers.</div></div><div class="turn assistant"><div class="role">assistant</div><div class="content">Good — you already know to check x = 2 and x = −2 because those are the boundary points where the formula changes. Continuity at each boundary means the left-hand limit and the right-hand limit (or the function values from the adjacent pieces) are equal to the value of the function at that point.

Step through each boundary:

1) At x = 2:
- The definition for −2 ≤ x ≤ 2 gives the function value at x = 2: f(2) = 2 − 5 = −3.
- For x &gt; 2 the formula is ax + 3, so the right-hand value as x → 2+ is a(2) + 3.
Continuity at x = 2 requires the right-hand value to equal f(2). Write that equation.

2) At x = −2:
- The middle piece gives f(−2) = (−2) − 5 = −7.
- For x &lt; −2 the formula is 2x − b, so the left-hand value as x → −2− is 2(−2) − b.
Continuity at x = −2 requires the left-hand value to equal f(−2). Write that equation.

So the two equations you should write are:
- a(2) + 3 = −3
- 2(−2) − b = −7

Now solve those two simple equations for a and b, then compute a + b. Try solving them and tell me what you get. If you want, I can check your arithmetic.</div></div><div class="turn user"><div class="role">user</div><div class="content">Thought: I understand which expressions to equate at x = 2 and x = −2 and have the two equations a(2)+3 = −3 and 2(−2) − b = −7. I&#x27;m not completely sure about the algebra steps to solve each for a and b (I haven&#x27;t been taught solving linear equations here), so I&#x27;ll ask for help with that step.

Message: I get the two equations a(2) + 3 = −3 and 2(−2) − b = −7. Can you show the algebra steps to solve each of these for a and b? I can do the arithmetic once I see the isolating steps.</div></div><div class="turn assistant"><div class="role">assistant</div><div class="content">Good — you set up the correct equations. I&#x27;ll show the algebraic steps to isolate a and b without doing the final arithmetic for you.

1) Solve 2a + 3 = −3 for a:
- Subtract 3 from both sides: 2a = −3 − 3.
- Divide both sides by 2: a = (−3 − 3)/2.

2) Solve 2(−2) − b = −7 for b:
- First compute 2(−2): that gives −4, so the equation is −4 − b = −7.
- Add 4 to both sides: −b = −7 + 4.
- Multiply both sides by −1: b = −(−7 + 4).

Now compute the arithmetic in those expressions for a and b, then add them to get a + b. Tell me what you get and I’ll confirm.</div></div><div class="turn user"><div class="role">user</div><div class="content">Thought: I followed your algebraic isolations and can compute the final arithmetic. From a = (−3 − 3)/2 and b = −(−7 + 4), I evaluate those expressions and add them. I understand the steps you showed and feel confident about the result.

Message: a = (−3 − 3)/2 = (−6)/2 = −3.  
b = −(−7 + 4) = −(−3) = 3.  
So a + b = −3 + 3 = 0.</div></div><div class="turn assistant"><div class="role">assistant</div><div class="content">Well done — your arithmetic and answers are correct. You solved the continuity equations properly and found a = −3, b = 3, so a + b = 0.

If you want to double-check: plug the values back into the boundary conditions.
- At x = 2: right-hand piece gives a(2)+3 = (−3)(2)+3 = −6+3 = −3, which matches middle piece f(2)=2−5=−3.
- At x = −2: left-hand piece gives 2(−2)−b = −4−3 = −7, which matches middle piece f(−2)=−2−5=−7.

Everything is continuous at both boundaries. Would you like a quick sketch or explanation of why checking those equalities ensures continuity?</div></div><div class="turn user"><div class="role">user</div><div class="content">Thought: I understand how the continuity equations were set up and the algebra steps to isolate a and b. I learned why equating the adjacent piece values at the boundaries ensures continuity. I&#x27;m satisfied with the solution a = −3, b = 3 and a + b = 0, so I&#x27;m confident and ready to finish.
