\\right.\\]Find $a+b$ if the piecewise function is continuous (which means that its graph can be drawn without lifting your pencil from the paper).</div><div class="meta">Problem ID: 0</div><div class="turn user"><div class="role">user</div><div class="content">Thought: I know what a piecewise function is and what continuity means at a point (no jumps). I understand the middle piece x-5 applies on [-2,2], so the function must match the adjacent pieces at x=2 and x=-2 for continuity. I&#x27;m unsure how to set up the actual equations that enforce those matches using the other two expressions (ax+3 for x&gt;2 and 2x-b for x&lt;-2), and then how to solve for a and b from those conditions.

Query: To ensure continuity, should I set the right-hand piece ax+3 equal to the middle piece at x=2, and the left-hand piece 2x-b equal to the middle piece at x=-2? If so, can you show those two equations explicitly?

Terminate: false</div></div><div class="turn assistant"><div class="role">assistant</div><div class="content">You&#x27;re on the right track. Continuity of a piecewise function at the boundary points means the left- and right-hand limits there equal the function value at the boundary. For this function the boundary points are x = 2 and x = −2.

Write the equality of the pieces that meet at each boundary:

- At x = 2, the middle piece (defined for −2 ≤ x ≤ 2) and the right-hand piece (defined for x &gt; 2) must agree when x approaches 2 from each side. So set the value of the right-hand piece at x = 2 equal to the middle piece at x = 2:
  a·(2) + 3 = (2) − 5.

- At x = −2, the middle piece (for −2 ≤ x ≤ 2) and the left-hand piece (for x &lt; −2) must agree when x approaches −2. So set the left-hand piece at x = −2 equal to the middle piece at x = −2:
  2·(−2) − b = (−2) − 5.

Those are the two equations you should solve for a and b. Do you want to solve them now and find a + b?</div></div><div class="turn user"><div class="role">user</div><div class="content">Thought: I see how to set up the equalities at x = 2 and x = −2 — that clarified piecewise continuity for me. I think next I should solve those two equations, but I&#x27;m a little unsure how to go from those equalities to specific numbers for a and b. Maybe I should try substituting the x-values into the equations and simplifying, but I&#x27;m not fully confident in solving both at once.

Message: Okay — I understand why we set a·2 + 3 = 2 − 5 at x = 2 and 2·(−2) − b = −2 − 5 at x = −2. Could you confirm if the next step is to evaluate each side (plug in the numbers) and then solve the resulting simple equations for a and b? If so, I can try that and tell you what I get.

Terminate: false</div></div><div class="turn assistant"><div class="role">assistant</div><div class="content">Yes — that&#x27;s exactly the next step. Evaluate each side (plug in x = 2 and x = −2) to get two simple equations in a and b, then solve them. Try those computations and tell me what you get for a and b; I’ll check them and help if needed.</div></div><div class="turn user"><div class="role">user</div><div class="content">Thought: I understand we set up a·2 + 3 = 2 − 5 and 2·(−2) − b = −2 − 5. I know the next step is to evaluate and solve for a and b, but I haven&#x27;t done the arithmetic yet. I&#x27;ll carry out the plug-ins and solve now.

Message: Okay — I&#x27;ll evaluate each equation now.

First equation: a·2 + 3 = 2 − 5
2a + 3 = -3
2a = -6
a = -3

Second equation: 2·(−2) − b = −2 − 5
-4 − b = -7
-b = -3
b = 3

So I get a = -3 and b = 3. That means a + b = 0. Does that look right?
