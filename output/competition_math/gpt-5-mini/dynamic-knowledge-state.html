I&#x27;m unsure how to set up the equations at x = ±2 correctly and then solve for a and b to get a+b.

Query: Can you show how to write the equations enforcing continuity at x = 2 and x = -2 for this piecewise function, and then solve those equations for a and b so I can compute a + b?</div></div><div class="turn assistant"><div class="role">assistant</div><div class="content">Good — continuity at the two breakpoints x = 2 and x = −2 is exactly what you need to enforce. Tell me what &quot;continuity at a point&quot; means in terms of left-hand and right-hand values, and then write the equalities that must hold at each breakpoint for f to be continuous. After you write those two equations, I’ll check them and help you solve for a and b.

Hint 1: At x = 2 you need the value from the middle piece (x − 5) to match the value from the right-hand piece (ax + 3) evaluated at x = 2. So one equation will come from plugging x = 2 into those two expressions and setting them equal.

Hint 2: At x = −2 you need the value from the middle piece (x − 5) to match the value from the left-hand piece (2x − b) evaluated at x = −2. So the second equation comes from plugging x = −2 into those two expressions and setting them equal.

Write those two equations, and post them here. If you want a nudge: evaluate x − 5 at x = 2 and at x = −2, and evaluate ax + 3 at x = 2 and 2x − b at x = −2, then equate as described.</div></div><div class="turn user"><div class="role">user</div><div class="content">Thought: I remember continuity means the left-hand and right-hand values at a point must be equal to the function value there. Following the hints, I should plug x = 2 and x = −2 into the given pieces and set them equal, but I&#x27;m not totally confident in the substitutions so I&#x27;ll write them explicitly.

Message:
At x = 2: (x − 5) evaluated at 2 equals (ax + 3) evaluated at 2, so
2 − 5 = a(2) + 3.

At x = −2: (x − 5) evaluated at −2 equals (2x − b) evaluated at −2, so
−2 − 5 = 2(−2) − b.</div></div><div class="turn assistant"><div class="role">assistant</div><div class="content">Nice work writing the continuity equations. Now simplify each and solve for the unknowns.

First equation (x = 2):
2 − 5 = 2a + 3
−3 = 2a + 3
Subtract 3: −6 = 2a
So a = −3.

Second equation (x = −2):
−2 − 5 = 2(−2) − b
−7 = −4 − b
Add 4: −3 = −b
So b = 3.

Finally compute a + b:
a + b = (−3) + 3 = 0.

So the piecewise function is continuous when a = −3 and b = 3, and a + b = 0.</div></div><div class="turn user"><div class="role">user</div><div class="content">Thought: I followed the steps you wrote and I see how you set the left and right values equal at each breakpoint and solved. I didn&#x27;t previously think to plug in the specific x-values into each piece and equate them that way, so that helped me understand enforcing continuity. The arithmetic and solving steps make sense and the answers a = −3 and b = 3 give a + b = 0. 

Message: Thanks — that explanation cleared it up for me. One quick question: is the general process always &quot;evaluate both adjacent pieces at the breakpoint and set them equal,&quot; even if the pieces are more complicated (like involving squares or rationals)?</div></div><div class="turn assistant"><div class="role">assistant</div><div class="content">Yes — that&#x27;s the general idea. For a function defined piecewise, continuity at a breakpoint c means the left-hand limit as x→c, the right-hand limit as x→c, and the function value at c (if defined) must all agree. Practically that becomes:

- If the left piece is defined for x &lt; c, evaluate its expression as x → c (usually just plug in c if the expression is defined there).
- If the right piece is defined for x &gt; c, evaluate its expression as x → c.
- If the piecewise definition gives a specific value at x = c, that value must equal those limits.

Set the left and right expressions equal at x = c; if the function is defined at c by one of the pieces, include that equality as well.

Notes and cautions for more complicated pieces:
- If a piece has a jump or a removable singularity (for example a rational expression with a factor that cancels), you may need to simplify first or consider limits rather than direct substitution. For example, (x^2−1)/(x−1) should be simplified to x+1 before evaluating at x=1, because direct substitution gives 0/0 but the limit is 2.
- If either side has a vertical asymptote at c (limit is ±∞ or does not exist), continuity is impossible there.
- For piecewise definitions involving absolute values, exponentials, trigonometric functions, etc., the same rule applies: compute the left- and right-hand limits and require equality.

So yes — evaluate the appropriate expressions at the breakpoint (or compute their limits there) and set them equal; then solve for any parameters that make those equalities true. Would you like an example with a rational expression that needs simplifying first?</div></div><div class="turn user"><div class="role">user</div><div class="content">Thought: I get that continuity means matching left and right limits at the breakpoints; I learned to simplify expressions first if substitution gives 0/0. I’m confident about setting the two adjacent pieces equal at each breakpoint and solving for parameters. I’m not confused about arithmetic, but I want to confirm handling when one piece is a rational that cancels — do I always simplify first and then evaluate the simplified expression at the breakpoint to get the limit?

Message: Thanks — that clarification about simplifying before evaluating when you get 0/0 makes sense. Quick question: when a piece simplifies (like (x^2−1)/(x−1) → x+1), is the correct procedure always to simplify algebraically first and then plug in the breakpoint to get the limit, or should I ever compute the limit directly without simplifying?</div></div><div class="turn assistant"><div class="role">assistant</div><div class="content">Good question — both approaches can be correct, and which you use depends on the situation and your goals. Here are the two common approaches and when each is appropriate:

1) Simplify algebraically first, then plug in
- When the expression is an algebraic rational function that has a common factor producing a removable 0/0 form at the point, it’s usually easiest to factor and cancel the common factor, then substitute the point into the simplified expression. Example: (x^2−1)/(x−1) = (x−1)(x+1)/(x−1) → x+1, so the limit as x→1 is 2.
- This is quick, gives an exact simplified form, and often reveals whether the singularity is removable (so the limit exists and equals the simplified value).
- Use this when algebraic manipulation is straightforward and safe (you’re not dividing by zero outside the cancellation step).

2) Compute the limit directly (epsilon/delta, series expansion, or limit rules)
- For more complicated cases where direct algebraic cancellation is messy or not obvious, you can apply limit laws, L’Hôpital’s Rule (when conditions are met), series expansions, or formal limit definitions.
- Example: if you encounter 0/0 but factoring is hard, L’Hôpital’s Rule (differentiate numerator and denominator) can produce the limit quickly, provided the functions are differentiable near the point.
- Use this when the expression involves non-polynomial pieces, complicated algebra, or when you want to justify the step rigorously (e.g., in a proof).

Practical guidance:
- If cancellation is obvious and safe, simplify first — it’s the fastest.
- If cancellation is not obvious or the algebra could hide domain issues, compute the limit using limit laws or L’Hôpital’s Rule.
- Always be mindful of domain: canceling a common factor removes the hole algebraically, but the original function may still be undefined at that point. For limits, that&#x27;s fine (we only care about behavior as x→c), but for continuity you must check whether the function value at c is defined and equals the limit.

Would you like to try a quick example where factoring works and another where L’Hôpital’s Rule is more convenient?</div></div><div class="turn user"><div class="role">user</div><div class="content">Thought: I get that simplifying algebraically first is usually fastest for rational expressions with a removable 0/0, and that L’Hôpital’s rule or limit laws are an alternative when simplification is hard. I hadn’t fully appreciated the domain caution — cancelling hides that the original function might be undefined at the point even though the limit exists. That makes sense. I’m still unsure when simplification could be unsafe or misleading in practice (besides the domain-note). Is there a specific example where canceling a factor would lead me to the wrong conclusion about continuity or the limit? 

Message: Thanks — that clarification helped. Can you show a short example where naive cancellation would mislead someone about continuity (so I see the domain issue in action), and then show the correct way to handle it?</div></div><div class="turn assistant"><div class="role">assistant</div><div class="content">Good — that&#x27;s a helpful thing to see. I&#x27;ll guide you through an example that highlights the domain (hole) issue and show how to handle it correctly. I won&#x27;t do every algebraic step for you; instead I&#x27;ll ask a few short questions so you think through the points where students often make the mistake.

Consider the function
g(x) = (x^2 − 1)/(x − 1) for x ≠ 1, and g(1) = 5.

1) First, what happens if you naively cancel the factor (x − 1) in the fraction? What simplified expression do you get for the fraction when x ≠ 1?

2) Using that simplified expression, what value would youcompute by plugging x = 1 into it? That gives the limit as x → 1 of the fraction. What is that limit?

3) Now, is g defined at x = 1? If so, what is g(1)? Compare the limit from step 2 to g(1). Are they equal?

4) Based on that comparison, is g continuous at x = 1? Explain why the act of cancellation did not change the limit but would mislead you only if you forgot to check the original function’s value at x = 1.

If you want, write your answers to 1–4 and I’ll check them and comment. Hint: cancelling (x − 1) is valid for finding the limit as x → 1, but it does not change the fact that the original rational expression is undefined at x = 1 (so there’s a hole) unless the piecewise definition assigns a value there that matches the limit.</div></div><div class="turn user"><div class="role">user</div><div class="content">Thought: I get that cancelling gives x+1 and the limit at 1 is 2, and that the original g(1)=5 so they&#x27;re not equal, so g isn&#x27;t continuous at 1. I learned that cancelling doesn&#x27;t change the limit but can hide the hole because the original expression was undefined at the breakpoint. I think I understand but want to confirm the reasoning step where we say &quot;cancelling is valid for finding the limit&quot; — is that always safe whenever you get 0/0 for a rational function? Also, if instead of assigning g(1)=5 the piecewise definition had g(1)=2, then g would be continuous, right?

Message: 1) Cancelling is safe for finding the limit of a rational function at a point that gives 0/0, because the cancelled form agrees with the original function on all nearby x≠c, so the limit is the same. 2) Yes—if g(1) were defined as 2 instead of 5, then the function would be continuous at x=1 because the value would match the limit. Is my understanding correct?</div></div><div class="turn assistant"><div class="role">assistant</div><div class="content">You&#x27;re on the right track, and your reasoning is mostly correct — but let&#x27;s make the specific numbers and conclusion for the example precise so there&#x27;s no confusion.

Recap the example: for x ≠ 1 define h(x) = (x^2 − 1)/(x − 1); and h(1) is then given as 5 (so the full piecewise function g(x) is h(x) for x ≠ 1 and g(1)=5).

1) Cancelling: (x^2 − 1)/(x − 1) = (x − 1)(x + 1)/(x − 1) = x + 1 for all x ≠ 1. So the simplified expression x + 1 agrees with the original rational expression at every point near 1 except at x = 1 itself. Thus the limit as x → 1 of the rational expression equals lim(x→1)(x + 1) = 2.

2) The limit is 2. The original rational expression is undefined at x = 1 (there is a &quot;hole&quot;), but the limit exists and equals 2.

3) The given g(1) in your example is 5. Since g(1) = 5 ≠ 2 = lim(x→1) g(x), g is not continuous at x = 1.

Your statement &quot;if g(1) were defined as 2 instead of 5, then the function would be continuous at x=1 because the value would match the limit&quot; is exactly right. Cancelling is safe for finding the limit, but continuity also requires the function&#x27;s actual value at the point to equal that limit.

A short summary rule: cancellation (or any algebraic simplification) can find the limit when you get 0/0, but you must always check the original function&#x27;s value at the point to decide continuity. Would you like another example where cancellation hides a removable discontinuity that is then &quot;filled&quot; by defining the function at the point?</div></div><div class="turn user"><div class="role">user</div><div class="content">Thought: I get that cancelling gives the same limit because the simplified form matches the original everywhere near the point except at the hole, and continuity also requires the actual value at the point to match that limit. I learned to always check the original function&#x27;s value after simplifying. I&#x27;m comfortable with using cancellation to find limits for rational functions that give 0/0, and with using L&#x27;Hôpital or limit laws when algebraic simplification is hard. I think I understand the domain issue now.

Message: Thanks — that made the domain/hole issue clear. One quick question to make sure I’ve got the procedure down: when a rational piece simplifies and gives a removable discontinuity, is it always valid to replace the piece with its simplified form when checking left- and right-hand limits at a breakpoint? Or should I sometimes compute the one-sided limits from the original unsimplified expression instead?</div></div><div class="turn assistant"><div class="role">assistant</div><div class="content">Good question — the short answer: yes, you may replace a rational piece by its simplified (cancelled) form when computing one-sided limits at the breakpoint, provided you remember why you&#x27;re allowed to do that. But there are some conditions and points to keep in mind; I&#x27;ll guide you through them with questions so you can be sure you&#x27;re applying the rule correctly.

Think about these points and answer them to yourself when you simplify:

1) Does the simplified expression equal the original expression for all x in some punctured neighborhood of the breakpoint (that is, for all x near c except possibly at x = c itself)? 
- If yes, then the original and simplified expressions have the same one-sided limits at c. Why? Limits only depend on values arbitrarily close to c, not the value at c itself.

2) Is the simplification purely algebraic cancellation of a common nonzero factor (e.g., (x−c) cancels) so that the only issue at c is a removable hole (0/0)? 
- If so, the simplified form gives the correct one-sided limits. Example: (x^2−1)/(x−1) simplifies to x+1 for x≠1, so left and right limits as x→1 equal 2.

3) Could the simplification change the behavior on a side because of domain restrictions that are asymmetric (left vs right)? 
- Rare for simple algebraic cancellations, but possible if the piece involves absolute values, square roots, or other operations that restrict domain differently on each side. In those cases, check domain near c on each side before substituting. For instance, sqrt((x−a)(something)) might be real only on one side of a.

4) Are you sure the expression isn&#x27;t hiding a non-removable singularity (like approaching ±∞ or oscillating)? 
- If cancellation doesn&#x27;t remove the 0/0 or if the denominator tends to 0 while numerator doesn&#x27;t, limits may be infinite or nonexistent; simplification won&#x27;t magically fix that. Use limit laws or other tests (factoring, L&#x27;Hôpital, etc.) to determine the true one-sided behavior.

So in practice:
- For rational functions with a removable factor (0/0), it&#x27;s standard and safe to simplify first and then evaluate the one-sided limits using the simplified expression.
- If the expression has radicals, absolute values, piecewise-defined conditions, or the limit form isn&#x27;t 0/0, be more cautious: either analyze the one-sided limits directly or justify that the simplification preserves the function on both sides of the point.

Would you like a quick example to practice deciding when simplification is safe versus when you should compute the one-sided limits from the original form?</div></div><div class="turn user"><div class="role">user</div><div class="content">Thought: I see that cancellation is safe for limits when the simplified form equals the original on a punctured neighborhood, and I need to watch for domain restrictions (like roots or absolute values) that could make one-sided behavior differ. I understand factoring/cancelling for 0/0 and that continuity also requires the function&#x27;s actual value at the point to match the limit. I&#x27;m still a bit unsure about recognizing when a simplification could change one-sided behavior because of domain restrictions — I know to check domain near the point, but could use a quick concrete example to solidify that.

Message: Thanks — that explanation helped. Could you show one short example where cancellation is safe (a rational 0/0 case) and one short example where an algebraic-looking simplification would be unsafe because of domain/asymmetry (involving a square root or absolute value) so I can contrast them?</div></div><div class="turn assistant"><div class="role">assistant</div><div class="content">Good — contrasting examples will make the rule concrete. I&#x27;ll give two short examples and ask a couple of guiding questions so you think through why the simplification is safe in the first case and unsafe in the second.

Example A (safe cancellation)
Define h(x) = (x^2 − 4)/(x − 2) for x ≠ 2. You want lim(x→2) h(x).

- Notice (x^2 − 4) = (x − 2)(x + 2), so for x ≠ 2 the fraction equals x + 2.
- Question: does x + 2 agree with the original expression for all x in some punctured neighborhood of 2 (i.e., for all x near 2 except x = 2 itself)? If yes, can you use x + 2 to compute the one-sided limits?
- Answer you should reach: Yes. So lim(x→2) h(x) = lim(x→2) (x + 2) = 4. Cancellation is safe here because the only issue at x = 2 is a removable hole (0/0).

Example B (unsafe to &quot;simplify&quot; without checking sides)
Consider k(x) = sqrt(x + 1)/(x + 1) for x ≠ −1 (and some value possibly assigned at x = −1). You might be tempted to &quot;cancel&quot; a factor (thinking sqrt(x+1) behaves like x+1), but that would be incorrect.

- Think about domain: sqrt(x + 1) is real only when x + 1 ≥ 0, so the expression is only defined for x ≥ −1. There is no neighborhood of −1 that contains points on both sides where the expression is defined; only the right-hand side (x &gt; −1) matters for limits in the real-valued sense.
- Compute the right-hand limit: for x &gt; −1, sqrt(x + 1)/(x + 1) = 1/sqrt(x + 1). As x → −1+ this tends to +∞ (blows up), so the one-sided limit is infinite.
- If someone incorrectly &quot;simplified&quot; by canceling sqrt(x+1) with (x+1) or treated sqrt(x+1) as if it were linear, they might wrongly conclude a finite limit. But because the domain is asymmetric (only right-side approach allowed) and because the algebraic form changes behavior near −1, cancellation would be misleading.
- Guiding question: What do the left-hand and right-hand approaches to −1 look like here? (Answer you should reach: left-hand approach doesn&#x27;t exist in the real domain; right-hand approach blows up.)

A second unsafe example with absolute value (same idea):
m(x) = (|x|)/(x) for x ≠ 0. One might &quot;simplify&quot; to 1, but that&#x27;s wrong globally: for x &gt; 0, |x|/x = 1; for x &lt; 0, |x|/x = −1. The left- and right-limits at 0 are different, so cancellation-like thinking would mislead you.

Summary checklist when deciding whether to simplify first:
- Is the problematic factor causing a 0/0 removable form for all nearby x (both sides)? If yes, simplifying is safe for computing one-sided limits.
- If the expression restricts domain asymmetrically (square roots, even roots, logs) or includes absolute values, check one-sided domains before simplifying; compute one-sided limits directly if necessary.
- Always remember limits depend on nearby values, not the value at the point. Simplification that is valid on a punctured neighborhood preserves limits; simplification that changes domain/behavior near the point can mislead.

Would you like to work through one of these examples yourself step by step?</div></div><div class="turn user"><div class="role">user</div><div class="content">Thought: I think I understand when simplification is safe — if the cancelled form equals the original on a punctured neighborhood so one-sided limits match. The examples with sqrt and absolute value made me see domain asymmetry can break that. I&#x27;m a bit unsure about cases with piecewise definitions that include radicals combined with rationals (e.g., (sqrt(x+1)−1)/(x) near x=0) — should I treat those by algebraic manipulation (conjugate multiplication) first or compute one-sided limits directly? Also not totally confident when L’Hôpital is allowed versus factoring.

Message: Thanks — that cleared up the domain/hole idea. Two quick questions so I don’t mess this up on homework:

1) For expressions that give 0/0 but involve radicals (like (sqrt(x+1)−1)/x as x→0), is the recommended first step to perform an algebraic manipulation (conjugate multiply) to simplify, and then plug in? Or should I prefer L’Hôpital’s Rule in those cases?

2) When deciding whether cancellation preserves one-sided limits, is the precise test just: “the simplified form equals the original for all x in some punctured neighborhood on the side(s) I care about”? So for one-sided limits I only need equality on that side’s punctured neighborhood, not both sides?

If those are right I’ll try a quick example and post my steps.</div></div><div class="turn assistant"><div class="role">assistant</div><div class="content">Both of those are good questions — your instincts are correct. Short answers first, then a little guidance so you can apply the ideas safely.

1) Radicals with 0/0 (conjugate vs L’Hôpital)
- Either approach can work. For expressions like (sqrt(x+1) − 1)/x as x → 0, a common and often simplest first step is to use an algebraic manipulation (multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate) to remove the radical and simplify, then substitute. That is fast, elementary, and avoids calculus.
- L’Hôpital’s Rule is also valid when you have a 0/0 indeterminate form and both numerator and denominator are differentiable near the point. It will give the same result, but it&#x27;s a heavier tool and requires checking the hypotheses (differentiability, and that the limit of derivatives exists or you can iterate L’Hôpital). Use it when algebraic simplification is messy or when you already know/are allowed to use it.
- Practical recommendation: try algebraic simplification first for simple radical rational forms; use L’Hôpital when simplification is unpleasant or you’re comfortable applying derivative rules.

2) Precise test for when simplification preserves one-sided limits
- Yes — that is exactly the right way to think about it. For a one-sided limit at c from the right, you only need the simplified form to agree with the original expression for all x in some punctured neighborhood to the right of c (i.e., for c &lt; x &lt; c + δ). Similarly for the left side you need agreement on (c − δ, c).
- Limits depend only on values arbitrarily close to the point from the side you approach from, not on the value at the point itself or on values on the opposite side. So equality on the relevant punctured neighborhood is sufficient.
- Reminder: also check that the simplification does not change domain or sign conditions that are relevant on that side (e.g., radicals, absolute values, logs). If the original expression is not defined on one side, that side’s limit may not exist (or may be irrelevant in a real-valued context).

If you want to practice, post your steps for the example you mentioned ( (sqrt(x+1) − 1)/x as x → 0 ) and I’ll check your algebra or suggest which method is simpler.</div></div><div class="turn user"><div class="role">user</div><div class="content">Thought: I followed the tutor’s explanations about when to simplify vs use L’Hôpital and the punctured-neighborhood test for one-sided limits. I think I understand that cancelling is allowed for limits if the simplified form equals the original on a punctured neighborhood on the relevant side, and that for (sqrt(x+1)−1)/x the conjugate trick is the preferred elementary step. I’m ready to try the example but want to check one detail I’m unsure about: when I multiply by the conjugate, I get rid of the radical in the numerator — is it always safe to multiply numerator and denominator by a factor that is zero at the limit point (like the conjugate evaluates to zero at x=0)? That feels like I&#x27;m introducing a 0/0 again in the denominator sometimes. Should I worry about that, or is it fine because I only need equality on a punctured neighborhood (not at the point)?

Message: Here are my steps — please check them:

1) Start with (sqrt(x+1) − 1)/x.
2) Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate: (sqrt(x+1) − 1)(sqrt(x+1) + 1) / (x (sqrt(x+1) + 1)).
3) Simplify the numerator: (x+1) − 1 = x, so expression becomes x / (x (sqrt(x+1) + 1)).
4) Cancel x (for x ≠ 0): 1 / (sqrt(x+1) + 1).
5) Now take the limit x → 0: 1 / (sqrt(1) + 1) = 1/2.

Questions: Did I mishandle cancelling x (any domain issue to note), and is it okay that I used the simplification before taking the limit? Anything else I should be explicit about when writing this on homework?</div></div><div class="turn assistant"><div class="role">assistant</div><div class="content">Nice, your steps are correct — well done. A few brief points to mention when you write this up, and a small question to check your understanding.

Corrections/confirmations of your steps
- Steps 1–4 are valid algebraic manipulations. Multiplying by the conjugate and simplifying gives x/(x(√(x+1)+1)), and cancelling x is justified because you&#x27;re working for x ≠ 0 (the limit concerns values arbitrarily close to 0 but not equal to 0).
- Step 5: after cancellation you get 1/(√(x+1)+1), which is continuous at x = 0, so you can substitute x = 0 to get 1/(1+1) = 1/2. That yields the limit.

Domain/zero issues to note when you write this on homework
- Explicitly note that you cancelled x only for x ≠ 0; that&#x27;s fine because limit x → 0 ignores the value at x = 0 itself. You can say &quot;for x ≠ 0, the expression equals 1/(√(x+1)+1), so the limit as x → 0 equals the value of that continuous function at 0.&quot;
- Also mention the domain restriction √(x+1) requires x ≥ −1. It doesn&#x27;t affect this limit at 0, but showing awareness of domain is good practice.

One quick check question for you: why is it safe to replace the original expression by the simplified one when computing the limit? (Short answer: because they agree for all x in some punctured neighborhood of 0.)</div></div><div class="turn user"><div class="role">user</div><div class="content">Thought: I understand the algebraic steps and why cancelling x is allowed for the limit, and I see the domain note about √(x+1) needing x ≥ −1. I should explicitly mention the punctured neighborhood justification when I write this up. I&#x27;m confident with the conjugate step and the final substitution.

Message: Thanks — that clarification makes sense. I&#x27;ll be explicit on my write-up that the cancellation is only for x ≠ 0 and that the simplified form equals the original on a punctured neighborhood of 0, so the limit is preserved. One quick check: is it enough to just say &quot;for x ≠ 0 the expression equals 1/(√(x+1)+1), so the limit equals its value at 0&quot; — or should I also state the domain restriction x ≥ −1 in the same sentence to be fully rigorous?</div></div><div class="turn assistant"><div class="role">assistant</div><div class="content">Either way is fine for most homework, but adding the domain remark is a small extra step that demonstrates full rigor and understanding — and it’s quick to do.

A concise strong phrasing you can use:
- &quot;For x ≠ 0 (and with x ≥ −1 so the expression is real), the expression equals 1/(√(x+1)+1). Since this simplified function is continuous at 0, lim_{x→0} (√(x+1)−1)/x = 1/(√1+1) = 1/2.&quot;

That says:
- you only cancelled for x ≠ 0,
- you acknowledged the real-domain restriction x ≥ −1,
- you explained why substitution is valid (continuity of the simplified function at 0).

If you prefer to keep it shorter and your instructor doesn&#x27;t demand extra commentary, the shorter sentence you suggested is usually acceptable:
- &quot;For x ≠ 0 the expression equals 1/(√(x+1)+1), so the limit equals its value at 0 = 1/2.&quot;

Either version is correct; include the domain note when you want to be extra careful or when the problem involves domain issues that could matter.</div></div><div class="turn user"><div class="role">user</div><div class="content">Thought: I understand that cancelling x was valid because the simplified form agrees with the original on a punctured neighborhood of 0, and that mentioning x ≥ −1 is a good extra rigor point. I learned to state both the cancellation restriction (x ≠ 0) and the domain restriction (x ≥ −1) when writing the limit justification.

Message: Thanks — that helps. I&#x27;ll write it as: &quot;For x ≠ 0 (and x ≥ −1) the expression equals 1/(√(x+1)+1), which is continuous at 0, so the limit is 1/2.&quot; Is that concise phrasing clear enough for typical homework, or should I explicitly mention &quot;we cancel x because x ≠ 0&quot; as well?</div></div><div class="turn assistant"><div class="role">assistant</div><div class="content">That phrasing is clear and concise and will be fine for typical homework. It already communicates the two key points: (1) you only use the simplified form where x ≠ 0 (so you&#x27;re not dividing by zero), and (2) you respect the domain x ≥ −1. You don&#x27;t need an extra sentence spelling out the cancellation step unless your instructor wants every algebraic step shown.

If you want the shortest fully explicit sentence that teachers like, you can write:

&quot;For x ≠ 0 (and x ≥ −1) the expression equals 1/(√(x+1)+1) after multiplying by the conjugate and cancelling x; this simplified function is continuous at 0, so the limit is 1/2.&quot;

That version names the cancellation step if you prefer to be explicit. Otherwise your original sentence is fine.</div></div><div class="turn user"><div class="role">user</div><div class="content">Thought: I understand the distinction between cancelling on a punctured neighborhood and checking domain; I should mention x ≠ 0 and x ≥ −1 when I write the limit. I&#x27;m not confused now.

Message: Thanks — I’ll use that phrasing. Quick confirmation: is this shortest version fine for most homework?

&quot;For x ≠ 0 (and x ≥ −1) the expression equals 1/(√(x+1)+1), which is continuous at 0, so the limit is 1/2.&quot;</div></div><div class="turn assistant"><div class="role">assistant</div><div class="content">Yes — that short version is fine for most homework. It states the simplification is only used off the problematic point (x ≠ 0), it notes the real-domain restriction (x ≥ −1), and it gives the justification (continuity of the simplified expression at 0) and the result. If you want to be slightly more explicit you can add &quot;after multiplying by the conjugate and cancelling x,&quot; but that&#x27;s optional. Good phrasing.</div></div><div class="turn user"><div class="role">user</div><div class="content">Thought: I understand why the conjugate trick works and that it&#x27;s safe to cancel x because the simplified form equals the original on a punctured neighborhood of 0; I should mention the domain x ≥ −1 when writing it up.

Message: Thanks — that explanation and the short phrasing make sense. I&#x27;ll use:

&quot;For x ≠ 0 (and x ≥ −1) the expression equals 1/(√(x+1)+1), which is continuous at 0, so the limit is 1/2.&quot;

If it&#x27;s okay, one quick follow-up: when an instructor asks for &quot;show work,&quot; do you think it&#x27;s better to include the explicit conjugate-multiplication step in one extra line, or is naming the method (&quot;multiply by the conjugate and cancel&quot;) sufficient most of the time?</div></div><div class="turn assistant"><div class="role">assistant</div><div class="content">Good question — it&#x27;s about matching your write-up to the expectations. Short answer: when an instructor asks to &quot;show work,&quot; include the explicit conjugate-multiplication line (one brief line is enough). Naming the method is helpful but usually not enough by itself.

Why write the extra line:
- It demonstrates you actually performed the algebra, not just quoted a method.
- It makes it easy for graders to follow and award partial credit if a small arithmetic mistake occurs later.
- It prevents any ambiguity about which algebraic manipulation you used.

How to do it concisely (one clear line that graders like):
- Write the original expression, then on the next line show the multiplication by the conjugate and the simplified result. For example:
  (√(x+1) − 1)/x = [(√(x+1) − 1)(√(x+1) + 1)] / [x(√(x+1) + 1)] = x / [x(√(x+1) + 1)] = 1/(√(x+1) + 1) for x ≠ 0.
- Then a final sentence: &quot;Since 1/(√(x+1)+1) is continuous at 0 (domain x ≥ −1), the limit as x→0 is 1/2.&quot;

That gives a compact but explicit &quot;showing of work&quot; and will satisfy most instructors.</div></div></div>
