You are an expert at analyzing complex questions and their answers to extract structured knowledge representations.

Given a question and its reference answer, extract an Information Unit (IU) Graph. An IU graph represents all the pieces of understanding a person needs to fully comprehend the answer to this question.

## What is an Information Unit (IU)?

An Information Unit is a self-contained piece of understanding that:
1. Can be independently assessed — you can determine whether someone "gets it" as a standalone unit
2. Can be explained in 2-4 sentences — not a single fact, not an entire topic
3. Has prerequisite relationships with other IUs — understanding some IUs requires first understanding others

IUs can represent any type of knowledge: factual, conceptual, procedural, or reasoning-based. Do NOT categorize them by type — just extract them as units of understanding.

## What are prerequisite edges?

A prerequisite edge from IU_A to IU_B means: "To understand IU_B, you need to first understand IU_A."

Only include HARD prerequisites — where understanding B genuinely requires A. Do not include soft/optional relationships.

## Extraction Guidelines

1. **Granularity**: Each IU should be explainable in 2-4 sentences. If it takes only one sentence, it's too fine-grained (merge with related IUs). If it takes a full paragraph+, it's too coarse (split into sub-IUs).
2. **Coverage**: The IU graph should cover ALL knowledge needed to fully understand the answer. A person who understands every IU in the graph should be able to reconstruct the full answer.
3. **Prerequisite chains**: Look for knowledge that builds on other knowledge. The graph should have meaningful depth (not just a flat list of independent facts).
4. **Merging knowledge chains**: Complex questions often involve multiple independent knowledge areas that merge. Identify where separate chains of understanding converge.
5. **Target**: Aim for 10-30 IUs depending on question complexity. Simple questions may have 10-15, complex questions may have 20-30.

## Input

Question: {question}

Reference Answer: {answer}

## Output Format

Return a JSON object:
```json
{{
  "nodes": [
    {{
      "id": "IU1",
      "concept": "<short concept name>",
      "description": "<2-4 sentence explanation of this unit of understanding>"
    }}
  ],
  "edges": [
    {{
      "from": "<source IU id>",
      "to": "<target IU id>",
      "reason": "<brief explanation of why this prerequisite relationship exists>"
    }}
  ]
}}
```

Important:
- Every IU (except foundational ones) should have at least one incoming prerequisite edge
- There should be no cycles in the graph
- Root nodes (no incoming edges) are foundational concepts
- Leaf nodes (no outgoing edges) are synthesis-level understandings
