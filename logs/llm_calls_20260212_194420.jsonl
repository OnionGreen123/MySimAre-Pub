Do not include soft/optional relationships.\n\n## Extraction Guidelines\n\n1. **Granularity**: Each IU should be explainable in 2-4 sentences. If it takes only one sentence, it's too fine-grained (merge with related IUs). If it takes a full paragraph+, it's too coarse (split into sub-IUs).\n2. **Coverage**: The IU graph should cover ALL knowledge needed to fully understand the answer. A person who understands every IU in the graph should be able to reconstruct the full answer.\n3. **Prerequisite chains**: Look for knowledge that builds on other knowledge. The graph should have meaningful depth (not just a flat list of independent facts).\n4. **Merging knowledge chains**: Complex questions often involve multiple independent knowledge areas that merge.

Can you show how to set up those two equations (not just solve them)?\n- AI Tutor: Good — you're asked only to set up the equations, not solve them. Continuity at a point means the left-hand limit and the right-hand limit at that point equal the function value there.\n\nFor x = 2:\n- The middle piece applies at x = 2, giving f(2) = 2 − 5.\n- The right-hand piece (x > 2) approaches x = 2 from the right, so its value as x → 2+ is a·x + 3 evaluated at x = 2, i.e. a·2 + 3.\n\nSet the right-hand limit equal to the value from the middle piece:\n2a + 3 = 2 − 5.\n\nFor x = −2:\n- The middle piece applies at x = −2, giving f(−2) = (−2) − 5.\n- The left-hand piece (x < −2) approaches x = −2 from the left, so its value as x → −2− is 2x − b evaluated at x = −2, i.e. 2(−2) − b.\n\nSet the left-hand limit equal to the value from the middle piece:\n2(−2) − b = (−2) − 5.\n\nThose two equations are the required setup for continuity. If you want, try solving them for a and b and then compute a + b. Which step would you like to do next?\n- You: Thanks — that clarification helped.

Continuity at a point means the left-hand limit and the right-hand limit at that point equal the function value there.\n\nFor x = 2:\n- The middle piece applies at x = 2, giving f(2) = 2 − 5.\n- The right-hand piece (x > 2) approaches x = 2 from the right, so its value as x → 2+ is a·x + 3 evaluated at x = 2, i.e. a·2 + 3.\n\nSet the right-hand limit equal to the value from the middle piece:\n2a + 3 = 2 − 5.\n\nFor x = −2:\n- The middle piece applies at x = −2, giving f(−2) = (−2) − 5.\n- The left-hand piece (x < −2) approaches x = −2 from the left, so its value as x → −2− is 2x − b evaluated at x = −2, i.e. 2(−2) − b.\n\nSet the left-hand limit equal to the value from the middle piece:\n2(−2) − b = (−2) − 5.\n\nThose two equations are the required setup for continuity. If you want, try solving them for a and b and then compute a + b. Which step would you like to do next?\n- You: Thanks — that clarification helped. I get the two setup equations:\n- 2a + 3 = 2 − 5\n- 2(−2) − b = (−2) − 5\n\nWould you like me to go ahead and solve these for a and b and then compute a + b?\n- AI Tutor: Yes — go ahead and solve them. A hint to keep you on track:\n\n- For 2a + 3 = 2 − 5, first simplify the right-hand side (2 − 5), then isolate a by subtracting 3 and dividing by 2.\n\n- For 2(−2) − b = (−2) − 5, first evaluate 2(−2) and simplify the right-hand side (−2 − 5), then solve for b by isolating −b and multiplying by −1.\n\nCompute a and b, then add them to get a + b. Tell me what you get and I’ll check your work or help if you get stuck.\n- You: For the first: 2a + 3 = 2 − 5 simplifies to 2a + 3 = −3, so 2a = −6 and a = −3.\n\nFor the second: 2(−2) − b = (−2) − 5 gives −4 − b = −7, so −b = −3 and b = 3.\n\nAdding them: a + b = −3 + 3 = 0. Is that correct?\n- AI Tutor: Nice work — you followed the steps exactly as suggested. Let's quickly check each line:\n\n- 2a + 3 = 2 − 5 → 2a + 3 = −3 → 2a = −6 → a = −3. Correct.\n- 2(−2) − b = −2 − 5 → −4 − b = −7 → −b = −3 → b = 3. Correct.\n\nSo a + b = −3 + 3 = 0. That is correct.\n\nDo you want to sketch or describe the graph briefly to see how continuity looks at x = ±2?\n- You: Yes — I understand now that for each boundary we equate the appropriate one-sided expression to the middle piece value to enforce continuity. Thanks! I'd like to describe the graph briefly: the middle piece is a line y = x − 5 on [−2,2], the left piece is y = 2x − b which meets the middle line at x = −2 (with b = 3) and the right piece is y = ax + 3 which meets at x = 2 (with a = −3). Everything is continuous at x = ±2. Would you like me to sketch the rough shape or label the intersection points?\n- AI Tutor: That description is exactly right — good job summarizing how the pieces meet.\n\nIf you want to deepen understanding, sketching would help. Try these quick steps and tell me what you draw or any questions about it:\n\n- Plot the middle segment y = x − 5 from x = −2 to x = 2. Mark the endpoints:\n  - At x = −2: y = −2 − 5 = −7 → point (−2, −7).\n  - At x = 2:  y =  2 − 5 = −3 → point (2, −3).\n\n- Plot the left piece y = 2x − b with b = 3 for x < −2. That's y = 2x − 3. Evaluate at x = −2 (the limit point):\n  - y = 2(−2) − 3 = −7, so it meets the middle piece at (−2, −7). Sketch the line continuing leftward (slope 2).\n\n- Plot the right piece y = ax + 3 with a = −3 for x > 2. That's y = −3x + 3. Evaluate at x = 2:\n  - y = −3(2) + 3 = −3, so it meets the middle piece at (2, −3). Sketch the line continuing rightward (slope −3).\n\nLabel the intersection points (−2, −7) and (2, −3). The overall graph will be a straight line with slope 2 to the left of x = −2, a straight segment with slope 1 between −2 and 2, and a straight line with slope −3 to the right of x = 2, with no jumps at the joining points.\n\nIf you want, you can sketch it and tell me if any slopes or intercepts look surprising — I can help interpret the shape or check your sketch.\n- You: Thanks — that helped a lot. I’ll sketch it as you described and label (−2, −7) and (2, −3). One quick question: is there any significance to the middle segment having slope 1 versus the outer slopes when considering differentiability at x = ±2, or is that outside this problem’s scope?\n- AI Tutor: Good question — that's exactly the right next thought. You’re allowed to think about it; I’ll guide you without doing all the work for you.\n\nContinuity is about matching function values at the boundaries; differentiability is about matching slopes (more precisely, matching the one-sided derivatives). So to check differentiability at x = 2 and x = −2, you should compare the slope of the middle piece (which is 1) to the slopes of the outer pieces at those points.\n\n- At x = 2: the right-hand piece has slope a (the coefficient of x in that piece). For differentiability there, the right-hand derivative must equal the derivative of the middle piece (1). So ask yourself: does a = 1? If not, the function is not differentiable at x = 2.\n\n- At x = −2: the left-hand piece has slope 2 (from 2x − b). For differentiability there, the left-hand derivative must equal the derivative of the middle piece (1). So ask: is 2 = 1? If not, the function is not differentiable at x = −2.\n\nUsing the values you found (a = −3 and b = 3), what do those comparisons tell you about differentiability at each point?

Tell me what you get and I’ll check your work or help if you get stuck.\n- You: For the first: 2a + 3 = 2 − 5 simplifies to 2a + 3 = −3, so 2a = −6 and a = −3.\n\nFor the second: 2(−2) − b = (−2) − 5 gives −4 − b = −7, so −b = −3 and b = 3.\n\nAdding them: a + b = −3 + 3 = 0. Is that correct?\n- AI Tutor: Nice work — you followed the steps exactly as suggested. Let's quickly check each line:\n\n- 2a + 3 = 2 − 5 → 2a + 3 = −3 → 2a = −6 → a = −3. Correct.\n- 2(−2) − b = −2 − 5 → −4 − b = −7 → −b = −3 → b = 3. Correct.\n\nSo a + b = −3 + 3 = 0. That is correct.\n\nDo you want to sketch or describe the graph briefly to see how continuity looks at x = ±2?\n- You: Yes — I understand now that for each boundary we equate the appropriate one-sided expression to the middle piece value to enforce continuity. Thanks! I'd like to describe the graph briefly: the middle piece is a line y = x − 5 on [−2,2], the left piece is y = 2x − b which meets the middle line at x = −2 (with b = 3) and the right piece is y = ax + 3 which meets at x = 2 (with a = −3). Everything is continuous at x = ±2. Would you like me to sketch the rough shape or label the intersection points?\n- AI Tutor: That description is exactly right — good job summarizing how the pieces meet.\n\nIf you want to deepen understanding, sketching would help. Try these quick steps and tell me what you draw or any questions about it:\n\n- Plot the middle segment y = x − 5 from x = −2 to x = 2. Mark the endpoints:\n  - At x = −2: y = −2 − 5 = −7 → point (−2, −7).\n  - At x = 2:  y =  2 − 5 = −3 → point (2, −3).\n\n- Plot the left piece y = 2x − b with b = 3 for x < −2. That's y = 2x − 3. Evaluate at x = −2 (the limit point):\n  - y = 2(−2) − 3 = −7, so it meets the middle piece at (−2, −7). Sketch the line continuing leftward (slope 2).\n\n- Plot the right piece y = ax + 3 with a = −3 for x > 2. That's y = −3x + 3. Evaluate at x = 2:\n  - y = −3(2) + 3 = −3, so it meets the middle piece at (2, −3). Sketch the line continuing rightward (slope −3).\n\nLabel the intersection points (−2, −7) and (2, −3). The overall graph will be a straight line with slope 2 to the left of x = −2, a straight segment with slope 1 between −2 and 2, and a straight line with slope −3 to the right of x = 2, with no jumps at the joining points.\n\nIf you want, you can sketch it and tell me if any slopes or intercepts look surprising — I can help interpret the shape or check your sketch.\n- You: Thanks — that helped a lot. I’ll sketch it as you described and label (−2, −7) and (2, −3). One quick question: is there any significance to the middle segment having slope 1 versus the outer slopes when considering differentiability at x = ±2, or is that outside this problem’s scope?\n- AI Tutor: Good question — that's exactly the right next thought. You’re allowed to think about it; I’ll guide you without doing all the work for you.\n\nContinuity is about matching function values at the boundaries; differentiability is about matching slopes (more precisely, matching the one-sided derivatives). So to check differentiability at x = 2 and x = −2, you should compare the slope of the middle piece (which is 1) to the slopes of the outer pieces at those points.\n\n- At x = 2: the right-hand piece has slope a (the coefficient of x in that piece). For differentiability there, the right-hand derivative must equal the derivative of the middle piece (1). So ask yourself: does a = 1? If not, the function is not differentiable at x = 2.\n\n- At x = −2: the left-hand piece has slope 2 (from 2x − b). For differentiability there, the left-hand derivative must equal the derivative of the middle piece (1). So ask: is 2 = 1? If not, the function is not differentiable at x = −2.\n\nUsing the values you found (a = −3 and b = 3), what do those comparisons tell you about differentiability at each point? Explain in one sentence for each point.\n- You: At x = −2 the left slope 2 ≠ middle slope 1, so not differentiable there. At x = 2 the right slope a = −3 ≠ 1, so not differentiable there either.\n- AI Tutor: Exactly — that's correct. Your reasoning is concise and complete.\n\n- At x = −2: left-hand slope = 2, middle slope = 1 → not differentiable.\n- At x = 2: right-hand slope = a = −3, middle slope = 1 → not differentiable.\n\nSo the function is continuous at both boundary points but not differentiable there because the one-sided derivatives (slopes) do not match the middle-piece slope.\n\n# Your Message Style\n## Interaction Style\n- Length of User Message: The user's query/response is always around 20 words.\n\n# Task\nGenerate your next message following these rules:\n1.

That is correct.\n\nDo you want to sketch or describe the graph briefly to see how continuity looks at x = ±2?\n- You: Yes — I understand now that for each boundary we equate the appropriate one-sided expression to the middle piece value to enforce continuity. Thanks! I'd like to describe the graph briefly: the middle piece is a line y = x − 5 on [−2,2], the left piece is y = 2x − b which meets the middle line at x = −2 (with b = 3) and the right piece is y = ax + 3 which meets at x = 2 (with a = −3). Everything is continuous at x = ±2. Would you like me to sketch the rough shape or label the intersection points?\n- AI Tutor: That description is exactly right — good job summarizing how the pieces meet.\n\nIf you want to deepen understanding, sketching would help. Try these quick steps and tell me what you draw or any questions about it:\n\n- Plot the middle segment y = x − 5 from x = −2 to x = 2. Mark the endpoints:\n  - At x = −2: y = −2 − 5 = −7 → point (−2, −7).\n  - At x = 2:  y =  2 − 5 = −3 → point (2, −3).\n\n- Plot the left piece y = 2x − b with b = 3 for x < −2. That's y = 2x − 3. Evaluate at x = −2 (the limit point):\n  - y = 2(−2) − 3 = −7, so it meets the middle piece at (−2, −7). Sketch the line continuing leftward (slope 2).\n\n- Plot the right piece y = ax + 3 with a = −3 for x > 2. That's y = −3x + 3. Evaluate at x = 2:\n  - y = −3(2) + 3 = −3, so it meets the middle piece at (2, −3). Sketch the line continuing rightward (slope −3).\n\nLabel the intersection points (−2, −7) and (2, −3). The overall graph will be a straight line with slope 2 to the left of x = −2, a straight segment with slope 1 between −2 and 2, and a straight line with slope −3 to the right of x = 2, with no jumps at the joining points.\n\nIf you want, you can sketch it and tell me if any slopes or intercepts look surprising — I can help interpret the shape or check your sketch.\n- You: Thanks — that helped a lot. I’ll sketch it as you described and label (−2, −7) and (2, −3). One quick question: is there any significance to the middle segment having slope 1 versus the outer slopes when considering differentiability at x = ±2, or is that outside this problem’s scope?\n- AI Tutor: Good question — that's exactly the right next thought. You’re allowed to think about it; I’ll guide you without doing all the work for you.\n\nContinuity is about matching function values at the boundaries; differentiability is about matching slopes (more precisely, matching the one-sided derivatives). So to check differentiability at x = 2 and x = −2, you should compare the slope of the middle piece (which is 1) to the slopes of the outer pieces at those points.\n\n- At x = 2: the right-hand piece has slope a (the coefficient of x in that piece). For differentiability there, the right-hand derivative must equal the derivative of the middle piece (1). So ask yourself: does a = 1? If not, the function is not differentiable at x = 2.\n\n- At x = −2: the left-hand piece has slope 2 (from 2x − b). For differentiability there, the left-hand derivative must equal the derivative of the middle piece (1). So ask: is 2 = 1? If not, the function is not differentiable at x = −2.\n\nUsing the values you found (a = −3 and b = 3), what do those comparisons tell you about differentiability at each point? Explain in one sentence for each point.\n- You: At x = −2 the left slope 2 ≠ middle slope 1, so not differentiable there. At x = 2 the right slope a = −3 ≠ 1, so not differentiable there either.\n- AI Tutor: Exactly — that's correct. Your reasoning is concise and complete.\n\n- At x = −2: left-hand slope = 2, middle slope = 1 → not differentiable.\n- At x = 2: right-hand slope = a = −3, middle slope = 1 → not differentiable.\n\nSo the function is continuous at both boundary points but not differentiable there because the one-sided derivatives (slopes) do not match the middle-piece slope.\n- You: Thanks — that clarification about matching one-sided values for continuity and matching slopes for differentiability was helpful. I’ve learned to (1) set the left/right expressions equal to the middle value at the boundaries to enforce continuity, and (2) compare the coefficients (slopes) to check differentiability. No more questions right now.\n- AI Tutor: You're welcome — great job working through it and noticing the distinction between continuity and differentiability.

Can you show how to set up those two equations (not just solve them)?\n- AI Tutor: Good — you're asked only to set up the equations, not solve them. Continuity at a point means the left-hand limit and the right-hand limit at that point equal the function value there.\n\nFor x = 2:\n- The middle piece applies at x = 2, giving f(2) = 2 − 5.\n- The right-hand piece (x > 2) approaches x = 2 from the right, so its value as x → 2+ is a·x + 3 evaluated at x = 2, i.e. a·2 + 3.\n\nSet the right-hand limit equal to the value from the middle piece:\n2a + 3 = 2 − 5.\n\nFor x = −2:\n- The middle piece applies at x = −2, giving f(−2) = (−2) − 5.\n- The left-hand piece (x < −2) approaches x = −2 from the left, so its value as x → −2− is 2x − b evaluated at x = −2, i.e. 2(−2) − b.\n\nSet the left-hand limit equal to the value from the middle piece:\n2(−2) − b = (−2) − 5.\n\nThose two equations are the required setup for continuity. If you want, try solving them for a and b and then compute a + b. Which step would you like to do next?\n- You: Thanks — that clarification helped. I get the two setup equations:\n- 2a + 3 = 2 − 5\n- 2(−2) − b = (−2) − 5\n\nWould you like me to go ahead and solve these for a and b and then compute a + b?\n- AI Tutor: Yes — go ahead and solve them. A hint to keep you on track:\n\n- For 2a + 3 = 2 − 5, first simplify the right-hand side (2 − 5), then isolate a by subtracting 3 and dividing by 2.\n\n- For 2(−2) − b = (−2) − 5, first evaluate 2(−2) and simplify the right-hand side (−2 − 5), then solve for b by isolating −b and multiplying by −1.\n\nCompute a and b, then add them to get a + b. Tell me what you get and I’ll check your work or help if you get stuck.\n- You: For the first: 2a + 3 = 2 − 5 simplifies to 2a + 3 = −3, so 2a = −6 and a = −3.\n\nFor the second: 2(−2) − b = (−2) − 5 gives −4 − b = −7, so −b = −3 and b = 3.\n\nAdding them: a + b = −3 + 3 = 0.

I’ll sketch it as you described and label (−2, −7) and (2, −3). One quick question: is there any significance to the middle segment having slope 1 versus the outer slopes when considering differentiability at x = ±2, or is that outside this problem’s scope?\n- AI Tutor: Good question — that's exactly the right next thought. You’re allowed to think about it; I’ll guide you without doing all the work for you.\n\nContinuity is about matching function values at the boundaries; differentiability is about matching slopes (more precisely, matching the one-sided derivatives). So to check differentiability at x = 2 and x = −2, you should compare the slope of the middle piece (which is 1) to the slopes of the outer pieces at those points.\n\n- At x = 2: the right-hand piece has slope a (the coefficient of x in that piece). For differentiability there, the right-hand derivative must equal the derivative of the middle piece (1). So ask yourself: does a = 1? If not, the function is not differentiable at x = 2.\n\n- At x = −2: the left-hand piece has slope 2 (from 2x − b). For differentiability there, the left-hand derivative must equal the derivative of the middle piece (1). So ask: is 2 = 1? If not, the function is not differentiable at x = −2.\n\nUsing the values you found (a = −3 and b = 3), what do those comparisons tell you about differentiability at each point? Explain in one sentence for each point.\n- You: At x = −2 the left slope 2 ≠ middle slope 1, so not differentiable there. At x = 2 the right slope a = −3 ≠ 1, so not differentiable there either.\n- AI Tutor: Exactly — that's correct. Your reasoning is concise and complete.\n\n- At x = −2: left-hand slope = 2, middle slope = 1 → not differentiable.\n- At x = 2: right-hand slope = a = −3, middle slope = 1 → not differentiable.\n\nSo the function is continuous at both boundary points but not differentiable there because the one-sided derivatives (slopes) do not match the middle-piece slope.\n- You: Thanks — that clarification about matching one-sided values for continuity and matching slopes for differentiability was helpful. I’ve learned to (1) set the left/right expressions equal to the middle value at the boundaries to enforce continuity, and (2) compare the coefficients (slopes) to check differentiability. No more questions right now.\n- AI Tutor: You're welcome — great job working through it and noticing the distinction between continuity and differentiability. If you want later, I can help you practice with more piecewise examples or show a quick sketch of this one.\n- You: Thanks — that summary helped me learn the methods.

Can you show how to set up those two equations (not just solve them)?\n- AI Tutor: Good — you're asked only to set up the equations, not solve them. Continuity at a point means the left-hand limit and the right-hand limit at that point equal the function value there.\n\nFor x = 2:\n- The middle piece applies at x = 2, giving f(2) = 2 − 5.\n- The right-hand piece (x > 2) approaches x = 2 from the right, so its value as x → 2+ is a·x + 3 evaluated at x = 2, i.e. a·2 + 3.\n\nSet the right-hand limit equal to the value from the middle piece:\n2a + 3 = 2 − 5.\n\nFor x = −2:\n- The middle piece applies at x = −2, giving f(−2) = (−2) − 5.\n- The left-hand piece (x < −2) approaches x = −2 from the left, so its value as x → −2− is 2x − b evaluated at x = −2, i.e. 2(−2) − b.\n\nSet the left-hand limit equal to the value from the middle piece:\n2(−2) − b = (−2) − 5.\n\nThose two equations are the required setup for continuity. If you want, try solving them for a and b and then compute a + b. Which step would you like to do next?\n- You: Thanks — that clarification helped. I get the two setup equations:\n- 2a + 3 = 2 − 5\n- 2(−2) − b = (−2) − 5\n\nWould you like me to go ahead and solve these for a and b and then compute a + b?\n- AI Tutor: Yes — go ahead and solve them.

Tell me what you get and I’ll check your work or help if you get stuck.\n- You: For the first: 2a + 3 = 2 − 5 simplifies to 2a + 3 = −3, so 2a = −6 and a = −3.\n\nFor the second: 2(−2) − b = (−2) − 5 gives −4 − b = −7, so −b = −3 and b = 3.\n\nAdding them: a + b = −3 + 3 = 0. Is that correct?\n- AI Tutor: Nice work — you followed the steps exactly as suggested. Let's quickly check each line:\n\n- 2a + 3 = 2 − 5 → 2a + 3 = −3 → 2a = −6 → a = −3. Correct.\n- 2(−2) − b = −2 − 5 → −4 − b = −7 → −b = −3 → b = 3. Correct.\n\nSo a + b = −3 + 3 = 0. That is correct.\n\nDo you want to sketch or describe the graph briefly to see how continuity looks at x = ±2?\n- You: Yes — I understand now that for each boundary we equate the appropriate one-sided expression to the middle piece value to enforce continuity. Thanks! I'd like to describe the graph briefly: the middle piece is a line y = x − 5 on [−2,2], the left piece is y = 2x − b which meets the middle line at x = −2 (with b = 3) and the right piece is y = ax + 3 which meets at x = 2 (with a = −3). Everything is continuous at x = ±2. Would you like me to sketch the rough shape or label the intersection points?\n- AI Tutor: That description is exactly right — good job summarizing how the pieces meet.\n\nIf you want to deepen understanding, sketching would help. Try these quick steps and tell me what you draw or any questions about it:\n\n- Plot the middle segment y = x − 5 from x = −2 to x = 2. Mark the endpoints:\n  - At x = −2: y = −2 − 5 = −7 → point (−2, −7).\n  - At x = 2:  y =  2 − 5 = −3 → point (2, −3).\n\n- Plot the left piece y = 2x − b with b = 3 for x < −2. That's y = 2x − 3. Evaluate at x = −2 (the limit point):\n  - y = 2(−2) − 3 = −7, so it meets the middle piece at (−2, −7). Sketch the line continuing leftward (slope 2).\n\n- Plot the right piece y = ax + 3 with a = −3 for x > 2. That's y = −3x + 3. Evaluate at x = 2:\n  - y = −3(2) + 3 = −3, so it meets the middle piece at (2, −3). Sketch the line continuing rightward (slope −3).\n\nLabel the intersection points (−2, −7) and (2, −3). The overall graph will be a straight line with slope 2 to the left of x = −2, a straight segment with slope 1 between −2 and 2, and a straight line with slope −3 to the right of x = 2, with no jumps at the joining points.\n\nIf you want, you can sketch it and tell me if any slopes or intercepts look surprising — I can help interpret the shape or check your sketch.\n- You: Thanks — that helped a lot. I’ll sketch it as you described and label (−2, −7) and (2, −3). One quick question: is there any significance to the middle segment having slope 1 versus the outer slopes when considering differentiability at x = ±2, or is that outside this problem’s scope?\n- AI Tutor: Good question — that's exactly the right next thought. You’re allowed to think about it; I’ll guide you without doing all the work for you.\n\nContinuity is about matching function values at the boundaries; differentiability is about matching slopes (more precisely, matching the one-sided derivatives). So to check differentiability at x = 2 and x = −2, you should compare the slope of the middle piece (which is 1) to the slopes of the outer pieces at those points.\n\n- At x = 2: the right-hand piece has slope a (the coefficient of x in that piece). For differentiability there, the right-hand derivative must equal the derivative of the middle piece (1). So ask yourself: does a = 1? If not, the function is not differentiable at x = 2.\n\n- At x = −2: the left-hand piece has slope 2 (from 2x − b). For differentiability there, the left-hand derivative must equal the derivative of the middle piece (1). So ask: is 2 = 1? If not, the function is not differentiable at x = −2.\n\nUsing the values you found (a = −3 and b = 3), what do those comparisons tell you about differentiability at each point? Explain in one sentence for each point.\n- You: At x = −2 the left slope 2 ≠ middle slope 1, so not differentiable there. At x = 2 the right slope a = −3 ≠ 1, so not differentiable there either.\n- AI Tutor: Exactly — that's correct. Your reasoning is concise and complete.\n\n- At x = −2: left-hand slope = 2, middle slope = 1 → not differentiable.\n- At x = 2: right-hand slope = a = −3, middle slope = 1 → not differentiable.\n\nSo the function is continuous at both boundary points but not differentiable there because the one-sided derivatives (slopes) do not match the middle-piece slope.\n- You: Thanks — that clarification about matching one-sided values for continuity and matching slopes for differentiability was helpful.

Correct.\n- 2(−2) − b = −2 − 5 → −4 − b = −7 → −b = −3 → b = 3. Correct.\n\nSo a + b = −3 + 3 = 0. That is correct.\n\nDo you want to sketch or describe the graph briefly to see how continuity looks at x = ±2?\n- You: Yes — I understand now that for each boundary we equate the appropriate one-sided expression to the middle piece value to enforce continuity. Thanks! I'd like to describe the graph briefly: the middle piece is a line y = x − 5 on [−2,2], the left piece is y = 2x − b which meets the middle line at x = −2 (with b = 3) and the right piece is y = ax + 3 which meets at x = 2 (with a = −3). Everything is continuous at x = ±2. Would you like me to sketch the rough shape or label the intersection points?\n- AI Tutor: That description is exactly right — good job summarizing how the pieces meet.\n\nIf you want to deepen understanding, sketching would help. Try these quick steps and tell me what you draw or any questions about it:\n\n- Plot the middle segment y = x − 5 from x = −2 to x = 2. Mark the endpoints:\n  - At x = −2: y = −2 − 5 = −7 → point (−2, −7).\n  - At x = 2:  y =  2 − 5 = −3 → point (2, −3).\n\n- Plot the left piece y = 2x − b with b = 3 for x < −2. That's y = 2x − 3. Evaluate at x = −2 (the limit point):\n  - y = 2(−2) − 3 = −7, so it meets the middle piece at (−2, −7). Sketch the line continuing leftward (slope 2).\n\n- Plot the right piece y = ax + 3 with a = −3 for x > 2. That's y = −3x + 3. Evaluate at x = 2:\n  - y = −3(2) + 3 = −3, so it meets the middle piece at (2, −3). Sketch the line continuing rightward (slope −3).\n\nLabel the intersection points (−2, −7) and (2, −3). The overall graph will be a straight line with slope 2 to the left of x = −2, a straight segment with slope 1 between −2 and 2, and a straight line with slope −3 to the right of x = 2, with no jumps at the joining points.\n\nIf you want, you can sketch it and tell me if any slopes or intercepts look surprising — I can help interpret the shape or check your sketch.\n- You: Thanks — that helped a lot. I’ll sketch it as you described and label (−2, −7) and (2, −3). One quick question: is there any significance to the middle segment having slope 1 versus the outer slopes when considering differentiability at x = ±2, or is that outside this problem’s scope?\n- AI Tutor: Good question — that's exactly the right next thought. You’re allowed to think about it; I’ll guide you without doing all the work for you.\n\nContinuity is about matching function values at the boundaries; differentiability is about matching slopes (more precisely, matching the one-sided derivatives). So to check differentiability at x = 2 and x = −2, you should compare the slope of the middle piece (which is 1) to the slopes of the outer pieces at those points.\n\n- At x = 2: the right-hand piece has slope a (the coefficient of x in that piece). For differentiability there, the right-hand derivative must equal the derivative of the middle piece (1). So ask yourself: does a = 1? If not, the function is not differentiable at x = 2.\n\n- At x = −2: the left-hand piece has slope 2 (from 2x − b). For differentiability there, the left-hand derivative must equal the derivative of the middle piece (1). So ask: is 2 = 1? If not, the function is not differentiable at x = −2.\n\nUsing the values you found (a = −3 and b = 3), what do those comparisons tell you about differentiability at each point? Explain in one sentence for each point.\n- You: At x = −2 the left slope 2 ≠ middle slope 1, so not differentiable there. At x = 2 the right slope a = −3 ≠ 1, so not differentiable there either.\n- AI Tutor: Exactly — that's correct. Your reasoning is concise and complete.\n\n- At x = −2: left-hand slope = 2, middle slope = 1 → not differentiable.\n- At x = 2: right-hand slope = a = −3, middle slope = 1 → not differentiable.\n\nSo the function is continuous at both boundary points but not differentiable there because the one-sided derivatives (slopes) do not match the middle-piece slope.\n- You: Thanks — that clarification about matching one-sided values for continuity and matching slopes for differentiability was helpful. I’ve learned to (1) set the left/right expressions equal to the middle value at the boundaries to enforce continuity, and (2) compare the coefficients (slopes) to check differentiability. No more questions right now.\n- AI Tutor: You're welcome — great job working through it and noticing the distinction between continuity and differentiability. If you want later, I can help you practice with more piecewise examples or show a quick sketch of this one.\n- You: Thanks — that summary helped me learn the methods. Quick question: when I state differentiability at a point formally, is it best to write it as\nlim_{h→0−} [f(x0+h)−f(x0)]/h = lim_{h→0+} [f(x0+h)−f(x0)]/h,\nor is there a more standard concise way you prefer?\n- AI Tutor: Good question — that limit equality is exactly the right idea. A slightly more standard concise way to write it is to state that the left-hand derivative equals the right-hand derivative at x0:\n\nf'-(x0) = f'+(x0),\n\nwhere\nf'-(x0) := lim_{h→0-} (f(x0+h) − f(x0))/h\nand\nf'+(x0) := lim_{h→0+} (f(x0+h) − f(x0))/h.\n\nYou can also write the equality of the two one-sided limits explicitly as you did:\nlim_{h→0-} (f(x0+h) − f(x0))/h = lim_{h→0+} (f(x0+h) − f(x0))/h.\n\nEither form is correct; the f'-(x0) = f'+(x0) notation is compact and commonly used once one has defined the one-sided derivatives.\n- You: Thanks — that notation clears it up. So for a formal statement I’ll write f'-(x0) = f'+(x0) and define each as the respective one-sided limit of (f(x0+h)−f(x0))/h. Quick check: when the piecewise parts are linear, I can just compare the coefficients (slopes) for the one-sided derivatives, right?\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that's correct. If each piece is an affine (linear) function on a neighborhood of the point (i.e., of the form mx + c), then the one-sided derivatives exist and equal the slope m on that side. So to check differentiability at a boundary point between two linear pieces you only need to compare the two slopes:\n\n- left one-sided derivative = slope of the left linear piece,\n- right one-sided derivative = slope of the right linear piece.\n\nIf those slopes are equal, the function is differentiable at the boundary; if they differ, it's not. (No need to compute limits in that case because the derivative of a linear function is constant and given by its coefficient of x.)\n- You: Thanks — that clarification helped a lot. Quick question about writing a brief formal justification: is it enough to write one sentence like \"Each piece is affine, so its derivative exists and equals its slope; hence the one-sided derivatives at a boundary equal the corresponding slopes, and differentiability at the boundary holds iff those slopes are equal\"? Or do I need to expand that into the limit definition explicitly in the proof?\n- AI Tutor: That one-sentence justification is fine in most contexts (homework, exams, or short proofs) as long as the audience knows the basic fact that affine functions have constant derivatives. It states the key reasons clearly and concisely.\n\nIf you need to be more formal (for example, in a rigorous analysis course or when the grader expects limit calculations), you can expand it by adding one short line showing the limit for an affine function:\n\n- For f(x) = m x + c, lim_{h→0} (f(x0+h) − f(x0))/h = lim_{h→0} (m(x0+h)+c − (m x0 + c))/h = lim_{h→0} m = m,\n\nand then apply that to each one-sided limit at the boundary. That directly shows the one-sided derivatives equal the slopes and completes the justification.\n\nSo use the one-sentence version when brevity is acceptable; expand to the limit calculation when you want full rigor.\n\n# Your Message Style\n## Interaction Style\n- Length of User Message: The user's query/response is always around 20 words.\n\n# Task\nGenerate your next message following these rules:\n1.

Would you like me to sketch the rough shape or label the intersection points?\n- AI Tutor: That description is exactly right — good job summarizing how the pieces meet.\n\nIf you want to deepen understanding, sketching would help. Try these quick steps and tell me what you draw or any questions about it:\n\n- Plot the middle segment y = x − 5 from x = −2 to x = 2. Mark the endpoints:\n  - At x = −2: y = −2 − 5 = −7 → point (−2, −7).\n  - At x = 2:  y =  2 − 5 = −3 → point (2, −3).\n\n- Plot the left piece y = 2x − b with b = 3 for x < −2. That's y = 2x − 3. Evaluate at x = −2 (the limit point):\n  - y = 2(−2) − 3 = −7, so it meets the middle piece at (−2, −7). Sketch the line continuing leftward (slope 2).\n\n- Plot the right piece y = ax + 3 with a = −3 for x > 2. That's y = −3x + 3. Evaluate at x = 2:\n  - y = −3(2) + 3 = −3, so it meets the middle piece at (2, −3). Sketch the line continuing rightward (slope −3).\n\nLabel the intersection points (−2, −7) and (2, −3). The overall graph will be a straight line with slope 2 to the left of x = −2, a straight segment with slope 1 between −2 and 2, and a straight line with slope −3 to the right of x = 2, with no jumps at the joining points.\n\nIf you want, you can sketch it and tell me if any slopes or intercepts look surprising — I can help interpret the shape or check your sketch.\n- You: Thanks — that helped a lot. I’ll sketch it as you described and label (−2, −7) and (2, −3). One quick question: is there any significance to the middle segment having slope 1 versus the outer slopes when considering differentiability at x = ±2, or is that outside this problem’s scope?\n- AI Tutor: Good question — that's exactly the right next thought. You’re allowed to think about it; I’ll guide you without doing all the work for you.\n\nContinuity is about matching function values at the boundaries; differentiability is about matching slopes (more precisely, matching the one-sided derivatives). So to check differentiability at x = 2 and x = −2, you should compare the slope of the middle piece (which is 1) to the slopes of the outer pieces at those points.\n\n- At x = 2: the right-hand piece has slope a (the coefficient of x in that piece). For differentiability there, the right-hand derivative must equal the derivative of the middle piece (1). So ask yourself: does a = 1? If not, the function is not differentiable at x = 2.\n\n- At x = −2: the left-hand piece has slope 2 (from 2x − b). For differentiability there, the left-hand derivative must equal the derivative of the middle piece (1). So ask: is 2 = 1? If not, the function is not differentiable at x = −2.\n\nUsing the values you found (a = −3 and b = 3), what do those comparisons tell you about differentiability at each point? Explain in one sentence for each point.\n- You: At x = −2 the left slope 2 ≠ middle slope 1, so not differentiable there. At x = 2 the right slope a = −3 ≠ 1, so not differentiable there either.\n- AI Tutor: Exactly — that's correct. Your reasoning is concise and complete.\n\n- At x = −2: left-hand slope = 2, middle slope = 1 → not differentiable.\n- At x = 2: right-hand slope = a = −3, middle slope = 1 → not differentiable.\n\nSo the function is continuous at both boundary points but not differentiable there because the one-sided derivatives (slopes) do not match the middle-piece slope.\n- You: Thanks — that clarification about matching one-sided values for continuity and matching slopes for differentiability was helpful. I’ve learned to (1) set the left/right expressions equal to the middle value at the boundaries to enforce continuity, and (2) compare the coefficients (slopes) to check differentiability. No more questions right now.\n- AI Tutor: You're welcome — great job working through it and noticing the distinction between continuity and differentiability. If you want later, I can help you practice with more piecewise examples or show a quick sketch of this one.\n- You: Thanks — that summary helped me learn the methods. Quick question: when I state differentiability at a point formally, is it best to write it as\nlim_{h→0−} [f(x0+h)−f(x0)]/h = lim_{h→0+} [f(x0+h)−f(x0)]/h,\nor is there a more standard concise way you prefer?\n- AI Tutor: Good question — that limit equality is exactly the right idea. A slightly more standard concise way to write it is to state that the left-hand derivative equals the right-hand derivative at x0:\n\nf'-(x0) = f'+(x0),\n\nwhere\nf'-(x0) := lim_{h→0-} (f(x0+h) − f(x0))/h\nand\nf'+(x0) := lim_{h→0+} (f(x0+h) − f(x0))/h.\n\nYou can also write the equality of the two one-sided limits explicitly as you did:\nlim_{h→0-} (f(x0+h) − f(x0))/h = lim_{h→0+} (f(x0+h) − f(x0))/h.\n\nEither form is correct; the f'-(x0) = f'+(x0) notation is compact and commonly used once one has defined the one-sided derivatives.\n- You: Thanks — that notation clears it up. So for a formal statement I’ll write f'-(x0) = f'+(x0) and define each as the respective one-sided limit of (f(x0+h)−f(x0))/h. Quick check: when the piecewise parts are linear, I can just compare the coefficients (slopes) for the one-sided derivatives, right?\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that's correct. If each piece is an affine (linear) function on a neighborhood of the point (i.e., of the form mx + c), then the one-sided derivatives exist and equal the slope m on that side. So to check differentiability at a boundary point between two linear pieces you only need to compare the two slopes:\n\n- left one-sided derivative = slope of the left linear piece,\n- right one-sided derivative = slope of the right linear piece.\n\nIf those slopes are equal, the function is differentiable at the boundary; if they differ, it's not. (No need to compute limits in that case because the derivative of a linear function is constant and given by its coefficient of x.)\n- You: Thanks — that clarification helped a lot. Quick question about writing a brief formal justification: is it enough to write one sentence like \"Each piece is affine, so its derivative exists and equals its slope; hence the one-sided derivatives at a boundary equal the corresponding slopes, and differentiability at the boundary holds iff those slopes are equal\"? Or do I need to expand that into the limit definition explicitly in the proof?\n- AI Tutor: That one-sentence justification is fine in most contexts (homework, exams, or short proofs) as long as the audience knows the basic fact that affine functions have constant derivatives. It states the key reasons clearly and concisely.\n\nIf you need to be more formal (for example, in a rigorous analysis course or when the grader expects limit calculations), you can expand it by adding one short line showing the limit for an affine function:\n\n- For f(x) = m x + c, lim_{h→0} (f(x0+h) − f(x0))/h = lim_{h→0} (m(x0+h)+c − (m x0 + c))/h = lim_{h→0} m = m,\n\nand then apply that to each one-sided limit at the boundary. That directly shows the one-sided derivatives equal the slopes and completes the justification.\n\nSo use the one-sentence version when brevity is acceptable; expand to the limit calculation when you want full rigor.\n- You: Thanks — that makes sense. I'll use the one-sentence justification in normal homework/exam settings and add the short limit line only when full rigor is required. One quick check: when I write the brief version, is it enough to say \"each piece is affine so its derivative equals its slope, hence the one-sided derivatives at the boundary equal those slopes,\" or should I explicitly mention \"therefore f'-(x0)=slope_left and f'+(x0)=slope_right\" to be fully clear?\n- AI Tutor: Either phrasing is fine; prefer the slightly more explicit version to avoid any possible ambiguity. A concise way that’s both clear and brief is:\n\n\"Each piece is affine, so its derivative exists and equals its slope. Hence the left one-sided derivative at the boundary equals the left piece’s slope and the right one-sided derivative equals the right piece’s slope; therefore f'-(x0)=slope_left and f'+(x0)=slope_right. Differentiability holds iff these slopes are equal.\"\n\nThat gives the key justification in one or two sentences while explicitly naming the one-sided derivatives. If you’re short on space, your original shorter wording is acceptable in most settings, but including the f'-(x0)=… and f'+(x0)=… line removes any doubt for the grader.\n\n# Your Message Style\n## Interaction Style\n- Length of User Message: The user's query/response is always around 20 words.\n\n# Task\nGenerate your next message following these rules:\n1.

Can you show how to set up those two equations (not just solve them)?\n- AI Tutor: Good — you're asked only to set up the equations, not solve them. Continuity at a point means the left-hand limit and the right-hand limit at that point equal the function value there.\n\nFor x = 2:\n- The middle piece applies at x = 2, giving f(2) = 2 − 5.\n- The right-hand piece (x > 2) approaches x = 2 from the right, so its value as x → 2+ is a·x + 3 evaluated at x = 2, i.e. a·2 + 3.\n\nSet the right-hand limit equal to the value from the middle piece:\n2a + 3 = 2 − 5.\n\nFor x = −2:\n- The middle piece applies at x = −2, giving f(−2) = (−2) − 5.\n- The left-hand piece (x < −2) approaches x = −2 from the left, so its value as x → −2− is 2x − b evaluated at x = −2, i.e. 2(−2) − b.\n\nSet the left-hand limit equal to the value from the middle piece:\n2(−2) − b = (−2) − 5.\n\nThose two equations are the required setup for continuity. If you want, try solving them for a and b and then compute a + b. Which step would you like to do next?\n- You: Thanks — that clarification helped. I get the two setup equations:\n- 2a + 3 = 2 − 5\n- 2(−2) − b = (−2) − 5\n\nWould you like me to go ahead and solve these for a and b and then compute a + b?\n- AI Tutor: Yes — go ahead and solve them. A hint to keep you on track:\n\n- For 2a + 3 = 2 − 5, first simplify the right-hand side (2 − 5), then isolate a by subtracting 3 and dividing by 2.\n\n- For 2(−2) − b = (−2) − 5, first evaluate 2(−2) and simplify the right-hand side (−2 − 5), then solve for b by isolating −b and multiplying by −1.\n\nCompute a and b, then add them to get a + b. Tell me what you get and I’ll check your work or help if you get stuck.\n- You: For the first: 2a + 3 = 2 − 5 simplifies to 2a + 3 = −3, so 2a = −6 and a = −3.\n\nFor the second: 2(−2) − b = (−2) − 5 gives −4 − b = −7, so −b = −3 and b = 3.\n\nAdding them: a + b = −3 + 3 = 0. Is that correct?\n- AI Tutor: Nice work — you followed the steps exactly as suggested. Let's quickly check each line:\n\n- 2a + 3 = 2 − 5 → 2a + 3 = −3 → 2a = −6 → a = −3. Correct.\n- 2(−2) − b = −2 − 5 → −4 − b = −7 → −b = −3 → b = 3. Correct.\n\nSo a + b = −3 + 3 = 0. That is correct.\n\nDo you want to sketch or describe the graph briefly to see how continuity looks at x = ±2?\n- You: Yes — I understand now that for each boundary we equate the appropriate one-sided expression to the middle piece value to enforce continuity. Thanks!

Mark the endpoints:\n  - At x = −2: y = −2 − 5 = −7 → point (−2, −7).\n  - At x = 2:  y =  2 − 5 = −3 → point (2, −3).\n\n- Plot the left piece y = 2x − b with b = 3 for x < −2. That's y = 2x − 3. Evaluate at x = −2 (the limit point):\n  - y = 2(−2) − 3 = −7, so it meets the middle piece at (−2, −7). Sketch the line continuing leftward (slope 2).\n\n- Plot the right piece y = ax + 3 with a = −3 for x > 2. That's y = −3x + 3. Evaluate at x = 2:\n  - y = −3(2) + 3 = −3, so it meets the middle piece at (2, −3). Sketch the line continuing rightward (slope −3).\n\nLabel the intersection points (−2, −7) and (2, −3). The overall graph will be a straight line with slope 2 to the left of x = −2, a straight segment with slope 1 between −2 and 2, and a straight line with slope −3 to the right of x = 2, with no jumps at the joining points.\n\nIf you want, you can sketch it and tell me if any slopes or intercepts look surprising — I can help interpret the shape or check your sketch.\n- You: Thanks — that helped a lot. I’ll sketch it as you described and label (−2, −7) and (2, −3). One quick question: is there any significance to the middle segment having slope 1 versus the outer slopes when considering differentiability at x = ±2, or is that outside this problem’s scope?\n- AI Tutor: Good question — that's exactly the right next thought. You’re allowed to think about it; I’ll guide you without doing all the work for you.\n\nContinuity is about matching function values at the boundaries; differentiability is about matching slopes (more precisely, matching the one-sided derivatives). So to check differentiability at x = 2 and x = −2, you should compare the slope of the middle piece (which is 1) to the slopes of the outer pieces at those points.\n\n- At x = 2: the right-hand piece has slope a (the coefficient of x in that piece). For differentiability there, the right-hand derivative must equal the derivative of the middle piece (1). So ask yourself: does a = 1? If not, the function is not differentiable at x = 2.\n\n- At x = −2: the left-hand piece has slope 2 (from 2x − b). For differentiability there, the left-hand derivative must equal the derivative of the middle piece (1). So ask: is 2 = 1? If not, the function is not differentiable at x = −2.\n\nUsing the values you found (a = −3 and b = 3), what do those comparisons tell you about differentiability at each point? Explain in one sentence for each point.\n- You: At x = −2 the left slope 2 ≠ middle slope 1, so not differentiable there. At x = 2 the right slope a = −3 ≠ 1, so not differentiable there either.\n- AI Tutor: Exactly — that's correct. Your reasoning is concise and complete.\n\n- At x = −2: left-hand slope = 2, middle slope = 1 → not differentiable.\n- At x = 2: right-hand slope = a = −3, middle slope = 1 → not differentiable.\n\nSo the function is continuous at both boundary points but not differentiable there because the one-sided derivatives (slopes) do not match the middle-piece slope.\n- You: Thanks — that clarification about matching one-sided values for continuity and matching slopes for differentiability was helpful. I’ve learned to (1) set the left/right expressions equal to the middle value at the boundaries to enforce continuity, and (2) compare the coefficients (slopes) to check differentiability. No more questions right now.\n- AI Tutor: You're welcome — great job working through it and noticing the distinction between continuity and differentiability. If you want later, I can help you practice with more piecewise examples or show a quick sketch of this one.\n- You: Thanks — that summary helped me learn the methods. Quick question: when I state differentiability at a point formally, is it best to write it as\nlim_{h→0−} [f(x0+h)−f(x0)]/h = lim_{h→0+} [f(x0+h)−f(x0)]/h,\nor is there a more standard concise way you prefer?\n- AI Tutor: Good question — that limit equality is exactly the right idea. A slightly more standard concise way to write it is to state that the left-hand derivative equals the right-hand derivative at x0:\n\nf'-(x0) = f'+(x0),\n\nwhere\nf'-(x0) := lim_{h→0-} (f(x0+h) − f(x0))/h\nand\nf'+(x0) := lim_{h→0+} (f(x0+h) − f(x0))/h.\n\nYou can also write the equality of the two one-sided limits explicitly as you did:\nlim_{h→0-} (f(x0+h) − f(x0))/h = lim_{h→0+} (f(x0+h) − f(x0))/h.\n\nEither form is correct; the f'-(x0) = f'+(x0) notation is compact and commonly used once one has defined the one-sided derivatives.\n- You: Thanks — that notation clears it up. So for a formal statement I’ll write f'-(x0) = f'+(x0) and define each as the respective one-sided limit of (f(x0+h)−f(x0))/h. Quick check: when the piecewise parts are linear, I can just compare the coefficients (slopes) for the one-sided derivatives, right?\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that's correct. If each piece is an affine (linear) function on a neighborhood of the point (i.e., of the form mx + c), then the one-sided derivatives exist and equal the slope m on that side. So to check differentiability at a boundary point between two linear pieces you only need to compare the two slopes:\n\n- left one-sided derivative = slope of the left linear piece,\n- right one-sided derivative = slope of the right linear piece.\n\nIf those slopes are equal, the function is differentiable at the boundary; if they differ, it's not. (No need to compute limits in that case because the derivative of a linear function is constant and given by its coefficient of x.)\n- You: Thanks — that clarification helped a lot. Quick question about writing a brief formal justification: is it enough to write one sentence like \"Each piece is affine, so its derivative exists and equals its slope; hence the one-sided derivatives at a boundary equal the corresponding slopes, and differentiability at the boundary holds iff those slopes are equal\"? Or do I need to expand that into the limit definition explicitly in the proof?\n- AI Tutor: That one-sentence justification is fine in most contexts (homework, exams, or short proofs) as long as the audience knows the basic fact that affine functions have constant derivatives. It states the key reasons clearly and concisely.\n\nIf you need to be more formal (for example, in a rigorous analysis course or when the grader expects limit calculations), you can expand it by adding one short line showing the limit for an affine function:\n\n- For f(x) = m x + c, lim_{h→0} (f(x0+h) − f(x0))/h = lim_{h→0} (m(x0+h)+c − (m x0 + c))/h = lim_{h→0} m = m,\n\nand then apply that to each one-sided limit at the boundary. That directly shows the one-sided derivatives equal the slopes and completes the justification.\n\nSo use the one-sentence version when brevity is acceptable; expand to the limit calculation when you want full rigor.\n- You: Thanks — that makes sense. I'll use the one-sentence justification in normal homework/exam settings and add the short limit line only when full rigor is required. One quick check: when I write the brief version, is it enough to say \"each piece is affine so its derivative equals its slope, hence the one-sided derivatives at the boundary equal those slopes,\" or should I explicitly mention \"therefore f'-(x0)=slope_left and f'+(x0)=slope_right\" to be fully clear?\n- AI Tutor: Either phrasing is fine; prefer the slightly more explicit version to avoid any possible ambiguity. A concise way that’s both clear and brief is:\n\n\"Each piece is affine, so its derivative exists and equals its slope. Hence the left one-sided derivative at the boundary equals the left piece’s slope and the right one-sided derivative equals the right piece’s slope; therefore f'-(x0)=slope_left and f'+(x0)=slope_right. Differentiability holds iff these slopes are equal.\"\n\nThat gives the key justification in one or two sentences while explicitly naming the one-sided derivatives. If you’re short on space, your original shorter wording is acceptable in most settings, but including the f'-(x0)=… and f'+(x0)=… line removes any doubt for the grader.\n- You: Thanks — that makes sense and I learned to prefer the explicit one-sided derivative notation. I'll write the short justification as:\n\n\"Each piece is affine, so its derivative exists and equals its slope. Hence f'-(x0)=slope_left and f'+(x0)=slope_right, so f is differentiable at x0 iff those slopes are equal.\"\n\nThat should be concise but unambiguous.\n- AI Tutor: Perfect — that wording is concise, clear, and mathematically precise. It makes the key points (affine ⇒ constant derivative, identification of one-sided derivatives, and the differentiability criterion) without unnecessary detail. Good choice for homework or an exam answer.\n\nIf you want, I can phrase it in a single polished sentence for you to copy/paste, or show the one-line limit justification you could add when full rigor is required.

A hint to keep you on track:\n\n- For 2a + 3 = 2 − 5, first simplify the right-hand side (2 − 5), then isolate a by subtracting 3 and dividing by 2.\n\n- For 2(−2) − b = (−2) − 5, first evaluate 2(−2) and simplify the right-hand side (−2 − 5), then solve for b by isolating −b and multiplying by −1.\n\nCompute a and b, then add them to get a + b. Tell me what you get and I’ll check your work or help if you get stuck.\n- You: For the first: 2a + 3 = 2 − 5 simplifies to 2a + 3 = −3, so 2a = −6 and a = −3.\n\nFor the second: 2(−2) − b = (−2) − 5 gives −4 − b = −7, so −b = −3 and b = 3.\n\nAdding them: a + b = −3 + 3 = 0. Is that correct?\n- AI Tutor: Nice work — you followed the steps exactly as suggested. Let's quickly check each line:\n\n- 2a + 3 = 2 − 5 → 2a + 3 = −3 → 2a = −6 → a = −3. Correct.\n- 2(−2) − b = −2 − 5 → −4 − b = −7 → −b = −3 → b = 3. Correct.\n\nSo a + b = −3 + 3 = 0. That is correct.\n\nDo you want to sketch or describe the graph briefly to see how continuity looks at x = ±2?\n- You: Yes — I understand now that for each boundary we equate the appropriate one-sided expression to the middle piece value to enforce continuity. Thanks! I'd like to describe the graph briefly: the middle piece is a line y = x − 5 on [−2,2], the left piece is y = 2x − b which meets the middle line at x = −2 (with b = 3) and the right piece is y = ax + 3 which meets at x = 2 (with a = −3). Everything is continuous at x = ±2. Would you like me to sketch the rough shape or label the intersection points?\n- AI Tutor: That description is exactly right — good job summarizing how the pieces meet.\n\nIf you want to deepen understanding, sketching would help. Try these quick steps and tell me what you draw or any questions about it:\n\n- Plot the middle segment y = x − 5 from x = −2 to x = 2. Mark the endpoints:\n  - At x = −2: y = −2 − 5 = −7 → point (−2, −7).\n  - At x = 2:  y =  2 − 5 = −3 → point (2, −3).\n\n- Plot the left piece y = 2x − b with b = 3 for x < −2. That's y = 2x − 3. Evaluate at x = −2 (the limit point):\n  - y = 2(−2) − 3 = −7, so it meets the middle piece at (−2, −7). Sketch the line continuing leftward (slope 2).\n\n- Plot the right piece y = ax + 3 with a = −3 for x > 2. That's y = −3x + 3. Evaluate at x = 2:\n  - y = −3(2) + 3 = −3, so it meets the middle piece at (2, −3). Sketch the line continuing rightward (slope −3).\n\nLabel the intersection points (−2, −7) and (2, −3). The overall graph will be a straight line with slope 2 to the left of x = −2, a straight segment with slope 1 between −2 and 2, and a straight line with slope −3 to the right of x = 2, with no jumps at the joining points.\n\nIf you want, you can sketch it and tell me if any slopes or intercepts look surprising — I can help interpret the shape or check your sketch.\n- You: Thanks — that helped a lot. I’ll sketch it as you described and label (−2, −7) and (2, −3). One quick question: is there any significance to the middle segment having slope 1 versus the outer slopes when considering differentiability at x = ±2, or is that outside this problem’s scope?\n- AI Tutor: Good question — that's exactly the right next thought. You’re allowed to think about it; I’ll guide you without doing all the work for you.\n\nContinuity is about matching function values at the boundaries; differentiability is about matching slopes (more precisely, matching the one-sided derivatives). So to check differentiability at x = 2 and x = −2, you should compare the slope of the middle piece (which is 1) to the slopes of the outer pieces at those points.\n\n- At x = 2: the right-hand piece has slope a (the coefficient of x in that piece). For differentiability there, the right-hand derivative must equal the derivative of the middle piece (1). So ask yourself: does a = 1? If not, the function is not differentiable at x = 2.\n\n- At x = −2: the left-hand piece has slope 2 (from 2x − b). For differentiability there, the left-hand derivative must equal the derivative of the middle piece (1). So ask: is 2 = 1? If not, the function is not differentiable at x = −2.\n\nUsing the values you found (a = −3 and b = 3), what do those comparisons tell you about differentiability at each point? Explain in one sentence for each point.\n- You: At x = −2 the left slope 2 ≠ middle slope 1, so not differentiable there. At x = 2 the right slope a = −3 ≠ 1, so not differentiable there either.\n- AI Tutor: Exactly — that's correct. Your reasoning is concise and complete.\n\n- At x = −2: left-hand slope = 2, middle slope = 1 → not differentiable.\n- At x = 2: right-hand slope = a = −3, middle slope = 1 → not differentiable.\n\nSo the function is continuous at both boundary points but not differentiable there because the one-sided derivatives (slopes) do not match the middle-piece slope.\n- You: Thanks — that clarification about matching one-sided values for continuity and matching slopes for differentiability was helpful. I’ve learned to (1) set the left/right expressions equal to the middle value at the boundaries to enforce continuity, and (2) compare the coefficients (slopes) to check differentiability. No more questions right now.\n- AI Tutor: You're welcome — great job working through it and noticing the distinction between continuity and differentiability. If you want later, I can help you practice with more piecewise examples or show a quick sketch of this one.\n- You: Thanks — that summary helped me learn the methods. Quick question: when I state differentiability at a point formally, is it best to write it as\nlim_{h→0−} [f(x0+h)−f(x0)]/h = lim_{h→0+} [f(x0+h)−f(x0)]/h,\nor is there a more standard concise way you prefer?\n- AI Tutor: Good question — that limit equality is exactly the right idea. A slightly more standard concise way to write it is to state that the left-hand derivative equals the right-hand derivative at x0:\n\nf'-(x0) = f'+(x0),\n\nwhere\nf'-(x0) := lim_{h→0-} (f(x0+h) − f(x0))/h\nand\nf'+(x0) := lim_{h→0+} (f(x0+h) − f(x0))/h.\n\nYou can also write the equality of the two one-sided limits explicitly as you did:\nlim_{h→0-} (f(x0+h) − f(x0))/h = lim_{h→0+} (f(x0+h) − f(x0))/h.\n\nEither form is correct; the f'-(x0) = f'+(x0) notation is compact and commonly used once one has defined the one-sided derivatives.\n- You: Thanks — that notation clears it up. So for a formal statement I’ll write f'-(x0) = f'+(x0) and define each as the respective one-sided limit of (f(x0+h)−f(x0))/h. Quick check: when the piecewise parts are linear, I can just compare the coefficients (slopes) for the one-sided derivatives, right?\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that's correct. If each piece is an affine (linear) function on a neighborhood of the point (i.e., of the form mx + c), then the one-sided derivatives exist and equal the slope m on that side. So to check differentiability at a boundary point between two linear pieces you only need to compare the two slopes:\n\n- left one-sided derivative = slope of the left linear piece,\n- right one-sided derivative = slope of the right linear piece.\n\nIf those slopes are equal, the function is differentiable at the boundary; if they differ, it's not. (No need to compute limits in that case because the derivative of a linear function is constant and given by its coefficient of x.)\n- You: Thanks — that clarification helped a lot. Quick question about writing a brief formal justification: is it enough to write one sentence like \"Each piece is affine, so its derivative exists and equals its slope; hence the one-sided derivatives at a boundary equal the corresponding slopes, and differentiability at the boundary holds iff those slopes are equal\"? Or do I need to expand that into the limit definition explicitly in the proof?\n- AI Tutor: That one-sentence justification is fine in most contexts (homework, exams, or short proofs) as long as the audience knows the basic fact that affine functions have constant derivatives. It states the key reasons clearly and concisely.\n\nIf you need to be more formal (for example, in a rigorous analysis course or when the grader expects limit calculations), you can expand it by adding one short line showing the limit for an affine function:\n\n- For f(x) = m x + c, lim_{h→0} (f(x0+h) − f(x0))/h = lim_{h→0} (m(x0+h)+c − (m x0 + c))/h = lim_{h→0} m = m,\n\nand then apply that to each one-sided limit at the boundary. That directly shows the one-sided derivatives equal the slopes and completes the justification.\n\nSo use the one-sentence version when brevity is acceptable; expand to the limit calculation when you want full rigor.\n- You: Thanks — that makes sense. I'll use the one-sentence justification in normal homework/exam settings and add the short limit line only when full rigor is required. One quick check: when I write the brief version, is it enough to say \"each piece is affine so its derivative equals its slope, hence the one-sided derivatives at the boundary equal those slopes,\" or should I explicitly mention \"therefore f'-(x0)=slope_left and f'+(x0)=slope_right\" to be fully clear?\n- AI Tutor: Either phrasing is fine; prefer the slightly more explicit version to avoid any possible ambiguity. A concise way that’s both clear and brief is:\n\n\"Each piece is affine, so its derivative exists and equals its slope. Hence the left one-sided derivative at the boundary equals the left piece’s slope and the right one-sided derivative equals the right piece’s slope; therefore f'-(x0)=slope_left and f'+(x0)=slope_right. Differentiability holds iff these slopes are equal.\"\n\nThat gives the key justification in one or two sentences while explicitly naming the one-sided derivatives. If you’re short on space, your original shorter wording is acceptable in most settings, but including the f'-(x0)=… and f'+(x0)=… line removes any doubt for the grader.\n- You: Thanks — that makes sense and I learned to prefer the explicit one-sided derivative notation. I'll write the short justification as:\n\n\"Each piece is affine, so its derivative exists and equals its slope. Hence f'-(x0)=slope_left and f'+(x0)=slope_right, so f is differentiable at x0 iff those slopes are equal.\"\n\nThat should be concise but unambiguous.\n- AI Tutor: Perfect — that wording is concise, clear, and mathematically precise. It makes the key points (affine ⇒ constant derivative, identification of one-sided derivatives, and the differentiability criterion) without unnecessary detail. Good choice for homework or an exam answer.\n\nIf you want, I can phrase it in a single polished sentence for you to copy/paste, or show the one-line limit justification you could add when full rigor is required. Which would you prefer?\n- You: Thanks — that phrasing works well for me. Could you please give the single polished sentence version to copy/paste, and also the one-line limit justification I can add if a grader wants full rigor?\n- AI Tutor: Here are both versions you asked for.\n\nSingle polished sentence (concise, copy/paste):\n\"Each piece is affine, so its derivative exists and equals its slope; hence the left one-sided derivative at x0 equals the left piece’s slope and the right one-sided derivative equals the right piece’s slope, so f is differentiable at x0 iff those slopes are equal.\"\n\nOne-line limit justification (for full rigor):\n\"For f(x)=mx+c, lim_{h→0} (f(x0+h)−f(x0))/h = lim_{h→0} (m(x0+h)+c − (mx0+c))/h = lim_{h→0} m = m, so the left/right one-sided derivatives at the boundary equal the respective piecewise slopes; hence differentiability at x0 requires equality of those slopes.\"\n\nIf you want, I can format these into a short paragraph that includes the specific slopes for your piecewise example.\n\n# Your Message Style\n## Interaction Style\n- Length of User Message: The user's query/response is always around 20 words.\n\n# Task\nGenerate your next message following these rules:\n1.

Can you show how to set up those two equations (not just solve them)?\n- AI Tutor: Good — you're asked only to set up the equations, not solve them. Continuity at a point means the left-hand limit and the right-hand limit at that point equal the function value there.\n\nFor x = 2:\n- The middle piece applies at x = 2, giving f(2) = 2 − 5.\n- The right-hand piece (x > 2) approaches x = 2 from the right, so its value as x → 2+ is a·x + 3 evaluated at x = 2, i.e. a·2 + 3.\n\nSet the right-hand limit equal to the value from the middle piece:\n2a + 3 = 2 − 5.\n\nFor x = −2:\n- The middle piece applies at x = −2, giving f(−2) = (−2) − 5.\n- The left-hand piece (x < −2) approaches x = −2 from the left, so its value as x → −2− is 2x − b evaluated at x = −2, i.e. 2(−2) − b.\n\nSet the left-hand limit equal to the value from the middle piece:\n2(−2) − b = (−2) − 5.\n\nThose two equations are the required setup for continuity.

Can you show how to set up those two equations (not just solve them)?\n- AI Tutor: Good — you're asked only to set up the equations, not solve them. Continuity at a point means the left-hand limit and the right-hand limit at that point equal the function value there.\n\nFor x = 2:\n- The middle piece applies at x = 2, giving f(2) = 2 − 5.\n- The right-hand piece (x > 2) approaches x = 2 from the right, so its value as x → 2+ is a·x + 3 evaluated at x = 2, i.e. a·2 + 3.\n\nSet the right-hand limit equal to the value from the middle piece:\n2a + 3 = 2 − 5.\n\nFor x = −2:\n- The middle piece applies at x = −2, giving f(−2) = (−2) − 5.\n- The left-hand piece (x < −2) approaches x = −2 from the left, so its value as x → −2− is 2x − b evaluated at x = −2, i.e. 2(−2) − b.\n\nSet the left-hand limit equal to the value from the middle piece:\n2(−2) − b = (−2) − 5.\n\nThose two equations are the required setup for continuity. If you want, try solving them for a and b and then compute a + b. Which step would you like to do next?\n- You: Thanks — that clarification helped. I get the two setup equations:\n- 2a + 3 = 2 − 5\n- 2(−2) − b = (−2) − 5\n\nWould you like me to go ahead and solve these for a and b and then compute a + b?\n- AI Tutor: Yes — go ahead and solve them. A hint to keep you on track:\n\n- For 2a + 3 = 2 − 5, first simplify the right-hand side (2 − 5), then isolate a by subtracting 3 and dividing by 2.\n\n- For 2(−2) − b = (−2) − 5, first evaluate 2(−2) and simplify the right-hand side (−2 − 5), then solve for b by isolating −b and multiplying by −1.\n\nCompute a and b, then add them to get a + b. Tell me what you get and I’ll check your work or help if you get stuck.\n- You: For the first: 2a + 3 = 2 − 5 simplifies to 2a + 3 = −3, so 2a = −6 and a = −3.\n\nFor the second: 2(−2) − b = (−2) − 5 gives −4 − b = −7, so −b = −3 and b = 3.\n\nAdding them: a + b = −3 + 3 = 0. Is that correct?\n- AI Tutor: Nice work — you followed the steps exactly as suggested. Let's quickly check each line:\n\n- 2a + 3 = 2 − 5 → 2a + 3 = −3 → 2a = −6 → a = −3. Correct.\n- 2(−2) − b = −2 − 5 → −4 − b = −7 → −b = −3 → b = 3. Correct.\n\nSo a + b = −3 + 3 = 0. That is correct.\n\nDo you want to sketch or describe the graph briefly to see how continuity looks at x = ±2?\n- You: Yes — I understand now that for each boundary we equate the appropriate one-sided expression to the middle piece value to enforce continuity. Thanks! I'd like to describe the graph briefly: the middle piece is a line y = x − 5 on [−2,2], the left piece is y = 2x − b which meets the middle line at x = −2 (with b = 3) and the right piece is y = ax + 3 which meets at x = 2 (with a = −3). Everything is continuous at x = ±2. Would you like me to sketch the rough shape or label the intersection points?\n- AI Tutor: That description is exactly right — good job summarizing how the pieces meet.\n\nIf you want to deepen understanding, sketching would help. Try these quick steps and tell me what you draw or any questions about it:\n\n- Plot the middle segment y = x − 5 from x = −2 to x = 2. Mark the endpoints:\n  - At x = −2: y = −2 − 5 = −7 → point (−2, −7).\n  - At x = 2:  y =  2 − 5 = −3 → point (2, −3).\n\n- Plot the left piece y = 2x − b with b = 3 for x < −2. That's y = 2x − 3. Evaluate at x = −2 (the limit point):\n  - y = 2(−2) − 3 = −7, so it meets the middle piece at (−2, −7). Sketch the line continuing leftward (slope 2).\n\n- Plot the right piece y = ax + 3 with a = −3 for x > 2. That's y = −3x + 3. Evaluate at x = 2:\n  - y = −3(2) + 3 = −3, so it meets the middle piece at (2, −3). Sketch the line continuing rightward (slope −3).\n\nLabel the intersection points (−2, −7) and (2, −3). The overall graph will be a straight line with slope 2 to the left of x = −2, a straight segment with slope 1 between −2 and 2, and a straight line with slope −3 to the right of x = 2, with no jumps at the joining points.\n\nIf you want, you can sketch it and tell me if any slopes or intercepts look surprising — I can help interpret the shape or check your sketch.\n- You: Thanks — that helped a lot. I’ll sketch it as you described and label (−2, −7) and (2, −3). One quick question: is there any significance to the middle segment having slope 1 versus the outer slopes when considering differentiability at x = ±2, or is that outside this problem’s scope?\n- AI Tutor: Good question — that's exactly the right next thought. You’re allowed to think about it; I’ll guide you without doing all the work for you.\n\nContinuity is about matching function values at the boundaries; differentiability is about matching slopes (more precisely, matching the one-sided derivatives). So to check differentiability at x = 2 and x = −2, you should compare the slope of the middle piece (which is 1) to the slopes of the outer pieces at those points.\n\n- At x = 2: the right-hand piece has slope a (the coefficient of x in that piece). For differentiability there, the right-hand derivative must equal the derivative of the middle piece (1). So ask yourself: does a = 1? If not, the function is not differentiable at x = 2.\n\n- At x = −2: the left-hand piece has slope 2 (from 2x − b). For differentiability there, the left-hand derivative must equal the derivative of the middle piece (1). So ask: is 2 = 1? If not, the function is not differentiable at x = −2.\n\nUsing the values you found (a = −3 and b = 3), what do those comparisons tell you about differentiability at each point? Explain in one sentence for each point.\n- You: At x = −2 the left slope 2 ≠ middle slope 1, so not differentiable there. At x = 2 the right slope a = −3 ≠ 1, so not differentiable there either.\n- AI Tutor: Exactly — that's correct. Your reasoning is concise and complete.\n\n- At x = −2: left-hand slope = 2, middle slope = 1 → not differentiable.\n- At x = 2: right-hand slope = a = −3, middle slope = 1 → not differentiable.\n\nSo the function is continuous at both boundary points but not differentiable there because the one-sided derivatives (slopes) do not match the middle-piece slope.\n- You: Thanks — that clarification about matching one-sided values for continuity and matching slopes for differentiability was helpful. I’ve learned to (1) set the left/right expressions equal to the middle value at the boundaries to enforce continuity, and (2) compare the coefficients (slopes) to check differentiability. No more questions right now.\n- AI Tutor: You're welcome — great job working through it and noticing the distinction between continuity and differentiability. If you want later, I can help you practice with more piecewise examples or show a quick sketch of this one.\n- You: Thanks — that summary helped me learn the methods. Quick question: when I state differentiability at a point formally, is it best to write it as\nlim_{h→0−} [f(x0+h)−f(x0)]/h = lim_{h→0+} [f(x0+h)−f(x0)]/h,\nor is there a more standard concise way you prefer?\n- AI Tutor: Good question — that limit equality is exactly the right idea. A slightly more standard concise way to write it is to state that the left-hand derivative equals the right-hand derivative at x0:\n\nf'-(x0) = f'+(x0),\n\nwhere\nf'-(x0) := lim_{h→0-} (f(x0+h) − f(x0))/h\nand\nf'+(x0) := lim_{h→0+} (f(x0+h) − f(x0))/h.\n\nYou can also write the equality of the two one-sided limits explicitly as you did:\nlim_{h→0-} (f(x0+h) − f(x0))/h = lim_{h→0+} (f(x0+h) − f(x0))/h.\n\nEither form is correct; the f'-(x0) = f'+(x0) notation is compact and commonly used once one has defined the one-sided derivatives.\n- You: Thanks — that notation clears it up. So for a formal statement I’ll write f'-(x0) = f'+(x0) and define each as the respective one-sided limit of (f(x0+h)−f(x0))/h. Quick check: when the piecewise parts are linear, I can just compare the coefficients (slopes) for the one-sided derivatives, right?\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that's correct. If each piece is an affine (linear) function on a neighborhood of the point (i.e., of the form mx + c), then the one-sided derivatives exist and equal the slope m on that side. So to check differentiability at a boundary point between two linear pieces you only need to compare the two slopes:\n\n- left one-sided derivative = slope of the left linear piece,\n- right one-sided derivative = slope of the right linear piece.\n\nIf those slopes are equal, the function is differentiable at the boundary; if they differ, it's not. (No need to compute limits in that case because the derivative of a linear function is constant and given by its coefficient of x.)\n- You: Thanks — that clarification helped a lot. Quick question about writing a brief formal justification: is it enough to write one sentence like \"Each piece is affine, so its derivative exists and equals its slope; hence the one-sided derivatives at a boundary equal the corresponding slopes, and differentiability at the boundary holds iff those slopes are equal\"? Or do I need to expand that into the limit definition explicitly in the proof?\n- AI Tutor: That one-sentence justification is fine in most contexts (homework, exams, or short proofs) as long as the audience knows the basic fact that affine functions have constant derivatives. It states the key reasons clearly and concisely.\n\nIf you need to be more formal (for example, in a rigorous analysis course or when the grader expects limit calculations), you can expand it by adding one short line showing the limit for an affine function:\n\n- For f(x) = m x + c, lim_{h→0} (f(x0+h) − f(x0))/h = lim_{h→0} (m(x0+h)+c − (m x0 + c))/h = lim_{h→0} m = m,\n\nand then apply that to each one-sided limit at the boundary. That directly shows the one-sided derivatives equal the slopes and completes the justification.\n\nSo use the one-sentence version when brevity is acceptable; expand to the limit calculation when you want full rigor.\n- You: Thanks — that makes sense. I'll use the one-sentence justification in normal homework/exam settings and add the short limit line only when full rigor is required. One quick check: when I write the brief version, is it enough to say \"each piece is affine so its derivative equals its slope, hence the one-sided derivatives at the boundary equal those slopes,\" or should I explicitly mention \"therefore f'-(x0)=slope_left and f'+(x0)=slope_right\" to be fully clear?\n- AI Tutor: Either phrasing is fine; prefer the slightly more explicit version to avoid any possible ambiguity. A concise way that’s both clear and brief is:\n\n\"Each piece is affine, so its derivative exists and equals its slope. Hence the left one-sided derivative at the boundary equals the left piece’s slope and the right one-sided derivative equals the right piece’s slope; therefore f'-(x0)=slope_left and f'+(x0)=slope_right. Differentiability holds iff these slopes are equal.\"\n\nThat gives the key justification in one or two sentences while explicitly naming the one-sided derivatives. If you’re short on space, your original shorter wording is acceptable in most settings, but including the f'-(x0)=… and f'+(x0)=… line removes any doubt for the grader.\n- You: Thanks — that makes sense and I learned to prefer the explicit one-sided derivative notation.

Hence f'-(x0)=slope_left and f'+(x0)=slope_right, so f is differentiable at x0 iff those slopes are equal.\"\n\nThat should be concise but unambiguous.\n- AI Tutor: Perfect — that wording is concise, clear, and mathematically precise. It makes the key points (affine ⇒ constant derivative, identification of one-sided derivatives, and the differentiability criterion) without unnecessary detail.

A slightly more standard concise way to write it is to state that the left-hand derivative equals the right-hand derivative at x0:\n\nf'-(x0) = f'+(x0),\n\nwhere\nf'-(x0) := lim_{h→0-} (f(x0+h) − f(x0))/h\nand\nf'+(x0) := lim_{h→0+} (f(x0+h) − f(x0))/h.\n\nYou can also write the equality of the two one-sided limits explicitly as you did:\nlim_{h→0-} (f(x0+h) − f(x0))/h = lim_{h→0+} (f(x0+h) − f(x0))/h.\n\nEither form is correct; the f'-(x0) = f'+(x0) notation is compact and commonly used once one has defined the one-sided derivatives."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thanks — that notation clears it up. So for a formal statement I’ll write f'-(x0) = f'+(x0) and define each as the respective one-sided limit of (f(x0+h)−f(x0))/h. Quick check: when the piecewise parts are linear, I can just compare the coefficients (slopes) for the one-sided derivatives, right?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes — that's correct. If each piece is an affine (linear) function on a neighborhood of the point (i.e., of the form mx + c), then the one-sided derivatives exist and equal the slope m on that side. So to check differentiability at a boundary point between two linear pieces you only need to compare the two slopes:\n\n- left one-sided derivative = slope of the left linear piece,\n- right one-sided derivative = slope of the right linear piece.\n\nIf those slopes are equal, the function is differentiable at the boundary; if they differ, it's not. (No need to compute limits in that case because the derivative of a linear function is constant and given by its coefficient of x.)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thanks — that clarification helped a lot. Quick question about writing a brief formal justification: is it enough to write one sentence like \"Each piece is affine, so its derivative exists and equals its slope; hence the one-sided derivatives at a boundary equal the corresponding slopes, and differentiability at the boundary holds iff those slopes are equal\"? Or do I need to expand that into the limit definition explicitly in the proof?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "That one-sentence justification is fine in most contexts (homework, exams, or short proofs) as long as the audience knows the basic fact that affine functions have constant derivatives. It states the key reasons clearly and concisely.\n\nIf you need to be more formal (for example, in a rigorous analysis course or when the grader expects limit calculations), you can expand it by adding one short line showing the limit for an affine function:\n\n- For f(x) = m x + c, lim_{h→0} (f(x0+h) − f(x0))/h = lim_{h→0} (m(x0+h)+c − (m x0 + c))/h = lim_{h→0} m = m,\n\nand then apply that to each one-sided limit at the boundary. That directly shows the one-sided derivatives equal the slopes and completes the justification.\n\nSo use the one-sentence version when brevity is acceptable; expand to the limit calculation when you want full rigor."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thanks — that makes sense. I'll use the one-sentence justification in normal homework/exam settings and add the short limit line only when full rigor is required. One quick check: when I write the brief version, is it enough to say \"each piece is affine so its derivative equals its slope, hence the one-sided derivatives at the boundary equal those slopes,\" or should I explicitly mention \"therefore f'-(x0)=slope_left and f'+(x0)=slope_right\" to be fully clear?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Either phrasing is fine; prefer the slightly more explicit version to avoid any possible ambiguity. A concise way that’s both clear and brief is:\n\n\"Each piece is affine, so its derivative exists and equals its slope. Hence the left one-sided derivative at the boundary equals the left piece’s slope and the right one-sided derivative equals the right piece’s slope; therefore f'-(x0)=slope_left and f'+(x0)=slope_right. Differentiability holds iff these slopes are equal.\"\n\nThat gives the key justification in one or two sentences while explicitly naming the one-sided derivatives. If you’re short on space, your original shorter wording is acceptable in most settings, but including the f'-(x0)=… and f'+(x0)=… line removes any doubt for the grader."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thanks — that makes sense and I learned to prefer the explicit one-sided derivative notation. I'll write the short justification as:\n\n\"Each piece is affine, so its derivative exists and equals its slope.

It makes the key points (affine ⇒ constant derivative, identification of one-sided derivatives, and the differentiability criterion) without unnecessary detail. Good choice for homework or an exam answer.\n\nIf you want, I can phrase it in a single polished sentence for you to copy/paste, or show the one-line limit justification you could add when full rigor is required.
