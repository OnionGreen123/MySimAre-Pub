Check the user's previous understanding level of all the prerequisites of the concept: if they are not well understood, that concept cannot be updated as well understood.\n3. Read the tutor's message, consider: has the tutor explained this concept clear enough? How well can the user understand it through that explanation?\n4.

Which function values should I compare at x = 2 and x = -2?\n- AI Tutor: Good — you're on the right track by thinking about the boundary points where the formula changes. Continuity at a boundary means the left-hand and right-hand limits (which for piecewise-defined simple formulas are just the function values from the appropriate pieces) agree there and equal the value of the function at that point.\n\nIdentify the two boundary points: x = 2 and x = −2.\n\n1. At x = 2:\n- For x > 2 the expression used is ax + 3, so the right-hand value at 2 is a·2 + 3 = 2a + 3.\n- For −2 ≤ x ≤ 2 the expression used at x = 2 is x − 5, so the value there is 2 − 5 = −3.\nContinuity at x = 2 requires the right-hand value equal the value at 2. Write that equation.\n\n2. At x = −2:\n- For −2 ≤ x ≤ 2 the expression at x = −2 is x − 5, so the value there is −2 − 5 = −7.\n- For x < −2 the expression used is 2x − b, so the left-hand value at −2 is 2(−2) − b = −4 − b.\nContinuity at x = −2 requires the left-hand value equal the value at −2. Write that equation.\n\nNow you have two equations in a and b. What are those equations? Solve them for a and b, then compute a + b. If you want, tell me the equations you wrote and your steps to solve them and I’ll check your work.\n- You: Okay — the equations I get are 2a + 3 = −3 (from x = 2) and −4 − b = −7 (from x = −2). Can you confirm those are set up correctly? Also, could you show the algebra to solve each for a and b and then compute a + b?\n- AI Tutor: You're correct about the two equations — those come from setting the appropriate piecewise expressions equal at the boundary points.

Continuity at a boundary means the left-hand and right-hand limits (which for piecewise-defined simple formulas are just the function values from the appropriate pieces) agree there and equal the value of the function at that point.\n\nIdentify the two boundary points: x = 2 and x = −2.\n\n1.

If evidence is insufficient, keep the previous state.\n* Use prerequisite evidence: if prerequisites are not well understood, do not assign knows_well.\n* Do not invent concepts or evidence; rely only on the given inputs.\n\nBelow is the process you should follow while analyzing and updating:\n1. Check the user's previous understanding level of this concept.\n2. Check the user's previous understanding level of all the prerequisites of the concept: if they are not well understood, that concept cannot be updated as well understood.\n3. Read the tutor's message, consider: has the tutor explained this concept clear enough? How well can the user understand it through that explanation?\n4. Read the user's message, consider: has the user demonstrated good understanding of this concept after the tutor's explanation? Or did the user express further confusion?\n5. Combine all the information above to decide the new level for the concept.\n\nBelow are the rules you should follow when analyzing and updating:\n1. The understanding level can never be downgraded by you.\n2. Consider the prerequisites along with user's current understanding: if the prerequisites of one concept are not well understood, that concept cannot be updated as well understood.\n3. If the tutor did not explain a concept in this turn, keep its state unchanged.\n\n## Tutor's Explanation\nYes — that rule is exactly right and is the general way to handle piecewise functions at boundary points.\n\nMore precisely:\n- The left-hand limit at a point x = c uses the formula that applies for x values slightly less than c (the piece covering values just to the left of c).\n- The right-hand limit at x = c uses the formula that applies for x values slightly greater than c (the piece covering values just to the right of c).\n- If the function is defined at c, its actual value f(c) may come from one of the pieces (depending on how the piecewise definition specifies the intervals). For continuity you need left-hand limit = right-hand limit = f(c).\n\nA couple of quick reminders:\n- Pay attention to whether the interval endpoints in the piecewise definition are included (≤ or ≥) or excluded (< or >). That tells you which piece gives f(c) itself.\n- Even if f(c) is defined by only one piece, both one-sided limits must still match that value for continuity.\n- If one-sided limits differ, the function has a jump discontinuity at c.\n\nIf you want, I can give a short example with different endpoint inclusions so you can practice identifying which piece to use for left, right, and f(c).

Which function values should I compare at x = 2 and x = -2?\n- AI Tutor: Good — you're on the right track by thinking about the boundary points where the formula changes. Continuity at a boundary means the left-hand and right-hand limits (which for piecewise-defined simple formulas are just the function values from the appropriate pieces) agree there and equal the value of the function at that point.\n\nIdentify the two boundary points: x = 2 and x = −2.\n\n1. At x = 2:\n- For x > 2 the expression used is ax + 3, so the right-hand value at 2 is a·2 + 3 = 2a + 3.\n- For −2 ≤ x ≤ 2 the expression used at x = 2 is x − 5, so the value there is 2 − 5 = −3.\nContinuity at x = 2 requires the right-hand value equal the value at 2. Write that equation.\n\n2. At x = −2:\n- For −2 ≤ x ≤ 2 the expression at x = −2 is x − 5, so the value there is −2 − 5 = −7.\n- For x < −2 the expression used is 2x − b, so the left-hand value at −2 is 2(−2) − b = −4 − b.\nContinuity at x = −2 requires the left-hand value equal the value at −2. Write that equation.\n\nNow you have two equations in a and b. What are those equations? Solve them for a and b, then compute a + b. If you want, tell me the equations you wrote and your steps to solve them and I’ll check your work.\n- You: Okay — the equations I get are 2a + 3 = −3 (from x = 2) and −4 − b = −7 (from x = −2). Can you confirm those are set up correctly? Also, could you show the algebra to solve each for a and b and then compute a + b?\n- AI Tutor: You're correct about the two equations — those come from setting the appropriate piecewise expressions equal at the boundary points. Now try solving each equation step by step; I'll guide you and check your work.\n\nStart with 2a + 3 = −3. Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the 2a term: what do you get next? \n\nThen move to −4 − b = −7. Add 4 to both sides to isolate −b: what does that give you, and what is b after you multiply or change sign?\n\nAfter you find a and b, add them to get a + b. Tell me the values you obtain and I'll confirm.\n- You: After solving, a = −3 and b = 3, so a + b = 0.\n- AI Tutor: Exactly right. Quick check of your steps:\n\n- From 2a + 3 = −3: subtract 3 to get 2a = −6, so a = −3.\n- From −4 − b = −7: add 4 to get −b = −3, so b = 3.\n- Then a + b = −3 + 3 = 0.\n\nEverything is correct. Nicely done.\n- You: Thanks — that explanation helped. One quick question: when deciding which piece to use for the left- or right-hand value at a boundary, is the rule always \"use the piece valid for x just less than the boundary for the left-hand limit, and the piece valid for x just greater than the boundary for the right-hand limit\"?

For continuity you need left-hand limit = right-hand limit = f(c).\n\nA couple of quick reminders:\n- Pay attention to whether the interval endpoints in the piecewise definition are included (≤ or ≥) or excluded (< or >).

Continuity at a boundary means the left-hand and right-hand limits (which for piecewise-defined simple formulas are just the function values from the appropriate pieces) agree there and equal the value of the function at that point.\n\nIdentify the two boundary points: x = 2 and x = −2.\n\n1. At x = 2:\n- For x > 2 the expression used is ax + 3, so the right-hand value at 2 is a·2 + 3 = 2a + 3.\n- For −2 ≤ x ≤ 2 the expression used at x = 2 is x − 5, so the value there is 2 − 5 = −3.\nContinuity at x = 2 requires the right-hand value equal the value at 2. Write that equation.\n\n2. At x = −2:\n- For −2 ≤ x ≤ 2 the expression at x = −2 is x − 5, so the value there is −2 − 5 = −7.\n- For x < −2 the expression used is 2x − b, so the left-hand value at −2 is 2(−2) − b = −4 − b.\nContinuity at x = −2 requires the left-hand value equal the value at −2. Write that equation.\n\nNow you have two equations in a and b. What are those equations? Solve them for a and b, then compute a + b. If you want, tell me the equations you wrote and your steps to solve them and I’ll check your work.\n- You: Okay — the equations I get are 2a + 3 = −3 (from x = 2) and −4 − b = −7 (from x = −2). Can you confirm those are set up correctly? Also, could you show the algebra to solve each for a and b and then compute a + b?\n- AI Tutor: You're correct about the two equations — those come from setting the appropriate piecewise expressions equal at the boundary points. Now try solving each equation step by step; I'll guide you and check your work.\n\nStart with 2a + 3 = −3. Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the 2a term: what do you get next? \n\nThen move to −4 − b = −7. Add 4 to both sides to isolate −b: what does that give you, and what is b after you multiply or change sign?\n\nAfter you find a and b, add them to get a + b. Tell me the values you obtain and I'll confirm.\n- You: After solving, a = −3 and b = 3, so a + b = 0.\n- AI Tutor: Exactly right. Quick check of your steps:\n\n- From 2a + 3 = −3: subtract 3 to get 2a = −6, so a = −3.\n- From −4 − b = −7: add 4 to get −b = −3, so b = 3.\n- Then a + b = −3 + 3 = 0.\n\nEverything is correct. Nicely done.\n- You: Thanks — that explanation helped. One quick question: when deciding which piece to use for the left- or right-hand value at a boundary, is the rule always \"use the piece valid for x just less than the boundary for the left-hand limit, and the piece valid for x just greater than the boundary for the right-hand limit\"? Just want to be sure I apply that correctly on future piecewise problems.\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that rule is exactly right and is the general way to handle piecewise functions at boundary points.\n\nMore precisely:\n- The left-hand limit at a point x = c uses the formula that applies for x values slightly less than c (the piece covering values just to the left of c).\n- The right-hand limit at x = c uses the formula that applies for x values slightly greater than c (the piece covering values just to the right of c).\n- If the function is defined at c, its actual value f(c) may come from one of the pieces (depending on how the piecewise definition specifies the intervals). For continuity you need left-hand limit = right-hand limit = f(c).\n\nA couple of quick reminders:\n- Pay attention to whether the interval endpoints in the piecewise definition are included (≤ or ≥) or excluded (< or >). That tells you which piece gives f(c) itself.\n- Even if f(c) is defined by only one piece, both one-sided limits must still match that value for continuity.\n- If one-sided limits differ, the function has a jump discontinuity at c.\n\nIf you want, I can give a short example with different endpoint inclusions so you can practice identifying which piece to use for left, right, and f(c). Which would you prefer?\n- You: Thanks — that makes sense and I see how to pick the pieces for left and right limits now. Quick follow-up: if the piecewise definition uses strict inequalities on both sides (so f(c) isn't defined by either piece), we still just compare the left- and right-hand expressions — do we then say the function is discontinuous at c unless those two one-sided limits happen to be equal? Is that the right way to state it?\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that's exactly right. If f(c) is not defined (because neither piece includes x = c), then for continuity at c you'd need both one-sided limits to exist and be equal; only then could you extend f to be continuous there by defining f(c) equal to that common value. If the left- and right-hand limits are different (or one/both fail to exist), the function has a discontinuity at c and you cannot make it continuous at c without changing the function.\n\nMore compactly:\n- If f(c) is defined: continuity at c requires left-hand limit = right-hand limit = f(c).\n- If f(c) is not defined: continuity at c would require left-hand limit = right-hand limit (and then you could define f(c) to be that common value to make it continuous). If the one-sided limits differ, the point is a jump discontinuity.\n\nGood thinking — do you want an example where f(c) isn't defined so you can practice deciding whether the limits match?\n\n# Your Message Style\n## Interaction Style\n- Length of User Message: The user's query/response is always around 20 words.\n\n# Task\nGenerate your next message following these rules:\n1.

Which function values should I compare at x = 2 and x = -2?\n- AI Tutor: Good — you're on the right track by thinking about the boundary points where the formula changes. Continuity at a boundary means the left-hand and right-hand limits (which for piecewise-defined simple formulas are just the function values from the appropriate pieces) agree there and equal the value of the function at that point.\n\nIdentify the two boundary points: x = 2 and x = −2.\n\n1. At x = 2:\n- For x > 2 the expression used is ax + 3, so the right-hand value at 2 is a·2 + 3 = 2a + 3.\n- For −2 ≤ x ≤ 2 the expression used at x = 2 is x − 5, so the value there is 2 − 5 = −3.\nContinuity at x = 2 requires the right-hand value equal the value at 2. Write that equation.\n\n2. At x = −2:\n- For −2 ≤ x ≤ 2 the expression at x = −2 is x − 5, so the value there is −2 − 5 = −7.\n- For x < −2 the expression used is 2x − b, so the left-hand value at −2 is 2(−2) − b = −4 − b.\nContinuity at x = −2 requires the left-hand value equal the value at −2. Write that equation.\n\nNow you have two equations in a and b. What are those equations? Solve them for a and b, then compute a + b. If you want, tell me the equations you wrote and your steps to solve them and I’ll check your work.\n- You: Okay — the equations I get are 2a + 3 = −3 (from x = 2) and −4 − b = −7 (from x = −2). Can you confirm those are set up correctly? Also, could you show the algebra to solve each for a and b and then compute a + b?\n- AI Tutor: You're correct about the two equations — those come from setting the appropriate piecewise expressions equal at the boundary points. Now try solving each equation step by step; I'll guide you and check your work.\n\nStart with 2a + 3 = −3. Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the 2a term: what do you get next? \n\nThen move to −4 − b = −7. Add 4 to both sides to isolate −b: what does that give you, and what is b after you multiply or change sign?\n\nAfter you find a and b, add them to get a + b. Tell me the values you obtain and I'll confirm.\n- You: After solving, a = −3 and b = 3, so a + b = 0.\n- AI Tutor: Exactly right. Quick check of your steps:\n\n- From 2a + 3 = −3: subtract 3 to get 2a = −6, so a = −3.\n- From −4 − b = −7: add 4 to get −b = −3, so b = 3.\n- Then a + b = −3 + 3 = 0.\n\nEverything is correct. Nicely done.\n- You: Thanks — that explanation helped. One quick question: when deciding which piece to use for the left- or right-hand value at a boundary, is the rule always \"use the piece valid for x just less than the boundary for the left-hand limit, and the piece valid for x just greater than the boundary for the right-hand limit\"? Just want to be sure I apply that correctly on future piecewise problems.\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that rule is exactly right and is the general way to handle piecewise functions at boundary points.\n\nMore precisely:\n- The left-hand limit at a point x = c uses the formula that applies for x values slightly less than c (the piece covering values just to the left of c).\n- The right-hand limit at x = c uses the formula that applies for x values slightly greater than c (the piece covering values just to the right of c).\n- If the function is defined at c, its actual value f(c) may come from one of the pieces (depending on how the piecewise definition specifies the intervals). For continuity you need left-hand limit = right-hand limit = f(c).\n\nA couple of quick reminders:\n- Pay attention to whether the interval endpoints in the piecewise definition are included (≤ or ≥) or excluded (< or >). That tells you which piece gives f(c) itself.\n- Even if f(c) is defined by only one piece, both one-sided limits must still match that value for continuity.\n- If one-sided limits differ, the function has a jump discontinuity at c.\n\nIf you want, I can give a short example with different endpoint inclusions so you can practice identifying which piece to use for left, right, and f(c). Which would you prefer?\n- You: Thanks — that makes sense and I see how to pick the pieces for left and right limits now. Quick follow-up: if the piecewise definition uses strict inequalities on both sides (so f(c) isn't defined by either piece), we still just compare the left- and right-hand expressions — do we then say the function is discontinuous at c unless those two one-sided limits happen to be equal? Is that the right way to state it?\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that's exactly right. If f(c) is not defined (because neither piece includes x = c), then for continuity at c you'd need both one-sided limits to exist and be equal; only then could you extend f to be continuous there by defining f(c) equal to that common value. If the left- and right-hand limits are different (or one/both fail to exist), the function has a discontinuity at c and you cannot make it continuous at c without changing the function.\n\nMore compactly:\n- If f(c) is defined: continuity at c requires left-hand limit = right-hand limit = f(c).\n- If f(c) is not defined: continuity at c would require left-hand limit = right-hand limit (and then you could define f(c) to be that common value to make it continuous). If the one-sided limits differ, the point is a jump discontinuity.\n\nGood thinking — do you want an example where f(c) isn't defined so you can practice deciding whether the limits match?\n- You: Thanks — that cleared it up. One quick thing I'd like to confirm: when checking continuity at a boundary I should first note which inequalities include the endpoint (≤ or ≥) to identify f(c) if it’s defined, then independently pick the piece for x<c for the left-hand limit and the piece for x>c for the right-hand limit, and finally compare left, right, and f(c) (if present). Is that the complete checklist I should use every time?\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that checklist is complete and a reliable procedure to follow every time.

In summary, when checking continuity at a boundary point c:\n\n1. Check whether f(c) is defined by looking at the interval endpoints (≤ / ≥ vs < / >). If included, determine f(c) from the piece that contains c.\n2. For the left-hand limit, use the formula that applies for x values just less than c (the piece covering x < c near c).\n3. For the right-hand limit, use the formula that applies for x values just greater than c (the piece covering x > c near c).\n4. Compare:\n   - If f(c) is defined: require left-hand limit = right-hand limit = f(c).\n   - If f(c) is not defined: require left-hand limit = right-hand limit in order for the function to be extendable to a continuous function at c; otherwise it's discontinuous.\n\nExtra tips:\n- Watch endpoint inclusions carefully — they determine which piece gives f(c).\n- You can compute the one-sided limits by directly substituting c into the corresponding formulas when those formulas are polynomials/linear (or otherwise continuous on their intervals).\n- If either one-sided limit does not exist, the function is discontinuous at c.\n\nWould you like a quick example to practice this checklist?\n\n# Conversation History\n- You: How do I use continuity at the boundary points to create equations for a and b? Which function values should I compare at x = 2 and x = -2?\n- AI Tutor: Good — you're on the right track by thinking about the boundary points where the formula changes. Continuity at a boundary means the left-hand and right-hand limits (which for piecewise-defined simple formulas are just the function values from the appropriate pieces) agree there and equal the value of the function at that point.\n\nIdentify the two boundary points: x = 2 and x = −2.\n\n1. At x = 2:\n- For x > 2 the expression used is ax + 3, so the right-hand value at 2 is a·2 + 3 = 2a + 3.\n- For −2 ≤ x ≤ 2 the expression used at x = 2 is x − 5, so the value there is 2 − 5 = −3.\nContinuity at x = 2 requires the right-hand value equal the value at 2. Write that equation.\n\n2. At x = −2:\n- For −2 ≤ x ≤ 2 the expression at x = −2 is x − 5, so the value there is −2 − 5 = −7.\n- For x < −2 the expression used is 2x − b, so the left-hand value at −2 is 2(−2) − b = −4 − b.\nContinuity at x = −2 requires the left-hand value equal the value at −2. Write that equation.\n\nNow you have two equations in a and b. What are those equations? Solve them for a and b, then compute a + b. If you want, tell me the equations you wrote and your steps to solve them and I’ll check your work.\n- You: Okay — the equations I get are 2a + 3 = −3 (from x = 2) and −4 − b = −7 (from x = −2). Can you confirm those are set up correctly? Also, could you show the algebra to solve each for a and b and then compute a + b?\n- AI Tutor: You're correct about the two equations — those come from setting the appropriate piecewise expressions equal at the boundary points. Now try solving each equation step by step; I'll guide you and check your work.\n\nStart with 2a + 3 = −3. Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the 2a term: what do you get next? \n\nThen move to −4 − b = −7. Add 4 to both sides to isolate −b: what does that give you, and what is b after you multiply or change sign?\n\nAfter you find a and b, add them to get a + b. Tell me the values you obtain and I'll confirm.\n- You: After solving, a = −3 and b = 3, so a + b = 0.\n- AI Tutor: Exactly right. Quick check of your steps:\n\n- From 2a + 3 = −3: subtract 3 to get 2a = −6, so a = −3.\n- From −4 − b = −7: add 4 to get −b = −3, so b = 3.\n- Then a + b = −3 + 3 = 0.\n\nEverything is correct. Nicely done.\n- You: Thanks — that explanation helped. One quick question: when deciding which piece to use for the left- or right-hand value at a boundary, is the rule always \"use the piece valid for x just less than the boundary for the left-hand limit, and the piece valid for x just greater than the boundary for the right-hand limit\"? Just want to be sure I apply that correctly on future piecewise problems.\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that rule is exactly right and is the general way to handle piecewise functions at boundary points.\n\nMore precisely:\n- The left-hand limit at a point x = c uses the formula that applies for x values slightly less than c (the piece covering values just to the left of c).\n- The right-hand limit at x = c uses the formula that applies for x values slightly greater than c (the piece covering values just to the right of c).\n- If the function is defined at c, its actual value f(c) may come from one of the pieces (depending on how the piecewise definition specifies the intervals). For continuity you need left-hand limit = right-hand limit = f(c).\n\nA couple of quick reminders:\n- Pay attention to whether the interval endpoints in the piecewise definition are included (≤ or ≥) or excluded (< or >). That tells you which piece gives f(c) itself.\n- Even if f(c) is defined by only one piece, both one-sided limits must still match that value for continuity.\n- If one-sided limits differ, the function has a jump discontinuity at c.\n\nIf you want, I can give a short example with different endpoint inclusions so you can practice identifying which piece to use for left, right, and f(c). Which would you prefer?\n- You: Thanks — that makes sense and I see how to pick the pieces for left and right limits now. Quick follow-up: if the piecewise definition uses strict inequalities on both sides (so f(c) isn't defined by either piece), we still just compare the left- and right-hand expressions — do we then say the function is discontinuous at c unless those two one-sided limits happen to be equal? Is that the right way to state it?\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that's exactly right. If f(c) is not defined (because neither piece includes x = c), then for continuity at c you'd need both one-sided limits to exist and be equal; only then could you extend f to be continuous there by defining f(c) equal to that common value. If the left- and right-hand limits are different (or one/both fail to exist), the function has a discontinuity at c and you cannot make it continuous at c without changing the function.\n\nMore compactly:\n- If f(c) is defined: continuity at c requires left-hand limit = right-hand limit = f(c).\n- If f(c) is not defined: continuity at c would require left-hand limit = right-hand limit (and then you could define f(c) to be that common value to make it continuous). If the one-sided limits differ, the point is a jump discontinuity.\n\nGood thinking — do you want an example where f(c) isn't defined so you can practice deciding whether the limits match?\n- You: Thanks — that cleared it up. One quick thing I'd like to confirm: when checking continuity at a boundary I should first note which inequalities include the endpoint (≤ or ≥) to identify f(c) if it’s defined, then independently pick the piece for x<c for the left-hand limit and the piece for x>c for the right-hand limit, and finally compare left, right, and f(c) (if present). Is that the complete checklist I should use every time?\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that checklist is complete and a reliable procedure to follow every time. In summary, when checking continuity at a boundary point c:\n\n1. Check whether f(c) is defined by looking at the interval endpoints (≤ / ≥ vs < / >). If included, determine f(c) from the piece that contains c.\n2. For the left-hand limit, use the formula that applies for x values just less than c (the piece covering x < c near c).\n3.

Which function values should I compare at x = 2 and x = -2?\n- AI Tutor: Good — you're on the right track by thinking about the boundary points where the formula changes. Continuity at a boundary means the left-hand and right-hand limits (which for piecewise-defined simple formulas are just the function values from the appropriate pieces) agree there and equal the value of the function at that point.\n\nIdentify the two boundary points: x = 2 and x = −2.\n\n1. At x = 2:\n- For x > 2 the expression used is ax + 3, so the right-hand value at 2 is a·2 + 3 = 2a + 3.\n- For −2 ≤ x ≤ 2 the expression used at x = 2 is x − 5, so the value there is 2 − 5 = −3.\nContinuity at x = 2 requires the right-hand value equal the value at 2. Write that equation.\n\n2. At x = −2:\n- For −2 ≤ x ≤ 2 the expression at x = −2 is x − 5, so the value there is −2 − 5 = −7.\n- For x < −2 the expression used is 2x − b, so the left-hand value at −2 is 2(−2) − b = −4 − b.\nContinuity at x = −2 requires the left-hand value equal the value at −2. Write that equation.\n\nNow you have two equations in a and b. What are those equations? Solve them for a and b, then compute a + b. If you want, tell me the equations you wrote and your steps to solve them and I’ll check your work.\n- You: Okay — the equations I get are 2a + 3 = −3 (from x = 2) and −4 − b = −7 (from x = −2). Can you confirm those are set up correctly? Also, could you show the algebra to solve each for a and b and then compute a + b?\n- AI Tutor: You're correct about the two equations — those come from setting the appropriate piecewise expressions equal at the boundary points. Now try solving each equation step by step; I'll guide you and check your work.\n\nStart with 2a + 3 = −3. Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the 2a term: what do you get next? \n\nThen move to −4 − b = −7. Add 4 to both sides to isolate −b: what does that give you, and what is b after you multiply or change sign?\n\nAfter you find a and b, add them to get a + b. Tell me the values you obtain and I'll confirm.\n- You: After solving, a = −3 and b = 3, so a + b = 0.\n- AI Tutor: Exactly right. Quick check of your steps:\n\n- From 2a + 3 = −3: subtract 3 to get 2a = −6, so a = −3.\n- From −4 − b = −7: add 4 to get −b = −3, so b = 3.\n- Then a + b = −3 + 3 = 0.\n\nEverything is correct. Nicely done.\n- You: Thanks — that explanation helped. One quick question: when deciding which piece to use for the left- or right-hand value at a boundary, is the rule always \"use the piece valid for x just less than the boundary for the left-hand limit, and the piece valid for x just greater than the boundary for the right-hand limit\"? Just want to be sure I apply that correctly on future piecewise problems.\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that rule is exactly right and is the general way to handle piecewise functions at boundary points.\n\nMore precisely:\n- The left-hand limit at a point x = c uses the formula that applies for x values slightly less than c (the piece covering values just to the left of c).\n- The right-hand limit at x = c uses the formula that applies for x values slightly greater than c (the piece covering values just to the right of c).\n- If the function is defined at c, its actual value f(c) may come from one of the pieces (depending on how the piecewise definition specifies the intervals). For continuity you need left-hand limit = right-hand limit = f(c).\n\nA couple of quick reminders:\n- Pay attention to whether the interval endpoints in the piecewise definition are included (≤ or ≥) or excluded (< or >). That tells you which piece gives f(c) itself.\n- Even if f(c) is defined by only one piece, both one-sided limits must still match that value for continuity.\n- If one-sided limits differ, the function has a jump discontinuity at c.\n\nIf you want, I can give a short example with different endpoint inclusions so you can practice identifying which piece to use for left, right, and f(c). Which would you prefer?\n- You: Thanks — that makes sense and I see how to pick the pieces for left and right limits now. Quick follow-up: if the piecewise definition uses strict inequalities on both sides (so f(c) isn't defined by either piece), we still just compare the left- and right-hand expressions — do we then say the function is discontinuous at c unless those two one-sided limits happen to be equal? Is that the right way to state it?\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that's exactly right. If f(c) is not defined (because neither piece includes x = c), then for continuity at c you'd need both one-sided limits to exist and be equal; only then could you extend f to be continuous there by defining f(c) equal to that common value. If the left- and right-hand limits are different (or one/both fail to exist), the function has a discontinuity at c and you cannot make it continuous at c without changing the function.\n\nMore compactly:\n- If f(c) is defined: continuity at c requires left-hand limit = right-hand limit = f(c).\n- If f(c) is not defined: continuity at c would require left-hand limit = right-hand limit (and then you could define f(c) to be that common value to make it continuous). If the one-sided limits differ, the point is a jump discontinuity.\n\nGood thinking — do you want an example where f(c) isn't defined so you can practice deciding whether the limits match?\n- You: Thanks — that cleared it up. One quick thing I'd like to confirm: when checking continuity at a boundary I should first note which inequalities include the endpoint (≤ or ≥) to identify f(c) if it’s defined, then independently pick the piece for x<c for the left-hand limit and the piece for x>c for the right-hand limit, and finally compare left, right, and f(c) (if present). Is that the complete checklist I should use every time?\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that checklist is complete and a reliable procedure to follow every time. In summary, when checking continuity at a boundary point c:\n\n1. Check whether f(c) is defined by looking at the interval endpoints (≤ / ≥ vs < / >). If included, determine f(c) from the piece that contains c.\n2. For the left-hand limit, use the formula that applies for x values just less than c (the piece covering x < c near c).\n3. For the right-hand limit, use the formula that applies for x values just greater than c (the piece covering x > c near c).\n4. Compare:\n   - If f(c) is defined: require left-hand limit = right-hand limit = f(c).\n   - If f(c) is not defined: require left-hand limit = right-hand limit in order for the function to be extendable to a continuous function at c; otherwise it's discontinuous.\n\nExtra tips:\n- Watch endpoint inclusions carefully — they determine which piece gives f(c).\n- You can compute the one-sided limits by directly substituting c into the corresponding formulas when those formulas are polynomials/linear (or otherwise continuous on their intervals).\n- If either one-sided limit does not exist, the function is discontinuous at c.\n\nWould you like a quick example to practice this checklist?\n- You: Thanks — that checklist makes sense and I see how to apply it. One question: if the boundary point is also the domain endpoint (so only one side of x exists in the domain), do I treat the absent side as \"not applicable\" or do I still require the existing one-sided limit to equal f(c) for continuity at that endpoint?\n- AI Tutor: Good question — endpoints of the domain are a special but simple case.\n\nIf c is an endpoint of the domain (so values only exist on one side of c), you treat the missing one-sided limit as not applicable. Continuity at c then requires that the one existing one-sided limit equals f(c).\n\nMore concretely:\n- If the domain includes values only for x ≥ c (left endpoint), check the right-hand limit lim_{x→c+} f(x). If f(c) is defined, continuity at c means lim_{x→c+} f(x) = f(c).

Write that equation.\n\n2. At x = −2:\n- For −2 ≤ x ≤ 2 the expression at x = −2 is x − 5, so the value there is −2 − 5 = −7.\n- For x < −2 the expression used is 2x − b, so the left-hand value at −2 is 2(−2) − b = −4 − b.\nContinuity at x = −2 requires the left-hand value equal the value at −2. Write that equation.\n\nNow you have two equations in a and b. What are those equations? Solve them for a and b, then compute a + b. If you want, tell me the equations you wrote and your steps to solve them and I’ll check your work.\n- You: Okay — the equations I get are 2a + 3 = −3 (from x = 2) and −4 − b = −7 (from x = −2). Can you confirm those are set up correctly? Also, could you show the algebra to solve each for a and b and then compute a + b?\n- AI Tutor: You're correct about the two equations — those come from setting the appropriate piecewise expressions equal at the boundary points. Now try solving each equation step by step; I'll guide you and check your work.\n\nStart with 2a + 3 = −3. Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the 2a term: what do you get next? \n\nThen move to −4 − b = −7. Add 4 to both sides to isolate −b: what does that give you, and what is b after you multiply or change sign?\n\nAfter you find a and b, add them to get a + b. Tell me the values you obtain and I'll confirm.\n- You: After solving, a = −3 and b = 3, so a + b = 0.\n- AI Tutor: Exactly right. Quick check of your steps:\n\n- From 2a + 3 = −3: subtract 3 to get 2a = −6, so a = −3.\n- From −4 − b = −7: add 4 to get −b = −3, so b = 3.\n- Then a + b = −3 + 3 = 0.\n\nEverything is correct. Nicely done.\n- You: Thanks — that explanation helped. One quick question: when deciding which piece to use for the left- or right-hand value at a boundary, is the rule always \"use the piece valid for x just less than the boundary for the left-hand limit, and the piece valid for x just greater than the boundary for the right-hand limit\"? Just want to be sure I apply that correctly on future piecewise problems.\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that rule is exactly right and is the general way to handle piecewise functions at boundary points.\n\nMore precisely:\n- The left-hand limit at a point x = c uses the formula that applies for x values slightly less than c (the piece covering values just to the left of c).\n- The right-hand limit at x = c uses the formula that applies for x values slightly greater than c (the piece covering values just to the right of c).\n- If the function is defined at c, its actual value f(c) may come from one of the pieces (depending on how the piecewise definition specifies the intervals). For continuity you need left-hand limit = right-hand limit = f(c).\n\nA couple of quick reminders:\n- Pay attention to whether the interval endpoints in the piecewise definition are included (≤ or ≥) or excluded (< or >). That tells you which piece gives f(c) itself.\n- Even if f(c) is defined by only one piece, both one-sided limits must still match that value for continuity.\n- If one-sided limits differ, the function has a jump discontinuity at c.\n\nIf you want, I can give a short example with different endpoint inclusions so you can practice identifying which piece to use for left, right, and f(c). Which would you prefer?\n- You: Thanks — that makes sense and I see how to pick the pieces for left and right limits now. Quick follow-up: if the piecewise definition uses strict inequalities on both sides (so f(c) isn't defined by either piece), we still just compare the left- and right-hand expressions — do we then say the function is discontinuous at c unless those two one-sided limits happen to be equal? Is that the right way to state it?\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that's exactly right. If f(c) is not defined (because neither piece includes x = c), then for continuity at c you'd need both one-sided limits to exist and be equal; only then could you extend f to be continuous there by defining f(c) equal to that common value. If the left- and right-hand limits are different (or one/both fail to exist), the function has a discontinuity at c and you cannot make it continuous at c without changing the function.\n\nMore compactly:\n- If f(c) is defined: continuity at c requires left-hand limit = right-hand limit = f(c).\n- If f(c) is not defined: continuity at c would require left-hand limit = right-hand limit (and then you could define f(c) to be that common value to make it continuous). If the one-sided limits differ, the point is a jump discontinuity.\n\nGood thinking — do you want an example where f(c) isn't defined so you can practice deciding whether the limits match?\n- You: Thanks — that cleared it up. One quick thing I'd like to confirm: when checking continuity at a boundary I should first note which inequalities include the endpoint (≤ or ≥) to identify f(c) if it’s defined, then independently pick the piece for x<c for the left-hand limit and the piece for x>c for the right-hand limit, and finally compare left, right, and f(c) (if present). Is that the complete checklist I should use every time?\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that checklist is complete and a reliable procedure to follow every time. In summary, when checking continuity at a boundary point c:\n\n1. Check whether f(c) is defined by looking at the interval endpoints (≤ / ≥ vs < / >). If included, determine f(c) from the piece that contains c.\n2. For the left-hand limit, use the formula that applies for x values just less than c (the piece covering x < c near c).\n3. For the right-hand limit, use the formula that applies for x values just greater than c (the piece covering x > c near c).\n4. Compare:\n   - If f(c) is defined: require left-hand limit = right-hand limit = f(c).\n   - If f(c) is not defined: require left-hand limit = right-hand limit in order for the function to be extendable to a continuous function at c; otherwise it's discontinuous.\n\nExtra tips:\n- Watch endpoint inclusions carefully — they determine which piece gives f(c).\n- You can compute the one-sided limits by directly substituting c into the corresponding formulas when those formulas are polynomials/linear (or otherwise continuous on their intervals).\n- If either one-sided limit does not exist, the function is discontinuous at c.\n\nWould you like a quick example to practice this checklist?\n- You: Thanks — that checklist makes sense and I see how to apply it. One question: if the boundary point is also the domain endpoint (so only one side of x exists in the domain), do I treat the absent side as \"not applicable\" or do I still require the existing one-sided limit to equal f(c) for continuity at that endpoint?\n- AI Tutor: Good question — endpoints of the domain are a special but simple case.\n\nIf c is an endpoint of the domain (so values only exist on one side of c), you treat the missing one-sided limit as not applicable. Continuity at c then requires that the one existing one-sided limit equals f(c).\n\nMore concretely:\n- If the domain includes values only for x ≥ c (left endpoint), check the right-hand limit lim_{x→c+} f(x). If f(c) is defined, continuity at c means lim_{x→c+} f(x) = f(c). (The left-hand limit lim_{x→c-} is not applicable.)\n- If the domain includes values only for x ≤ c (right endpoint), check the left-hand limit lim_{x→c-} f(x). Continuity at c means lim_{x→c-} f(x) = f(c). (The right-hand limit is not applicable.)\n\nIn short: at a domain endpoint you only require the one relevant one-sided limit to match f(c). If f(c) is not defined, you cannot have continuity at that endpoint (unless you extend the function by defining f(c) equal to the existing one-sided limit). \n\nWould you like a quick example of checking continuity at a domain endpoint?\n\n# Your Message Style\n## Interaction Style\n- Length of User Message: The user's query/response is always around 20 words.\n\n# Task\nGenerate your next message following these rules:\n1.

If it does, that is f(c).\n- If the formula is undefined at c, then f(c) is not defined (unless the problem explicitly states some defined value at c).\n- For continuity:\n  - If f(c) is defined, require the relevant one-sided limits equal f(c) (or both one-sided limits equal f(c) if c is an interior point).\n  - If f(c) is not defined, continuity at c would require the one-sided limits (the ones that make sense given the domain) to exist and be equal; then you could define f(c) to be that common limit to make the function continuous there.

However, the one-sided limit (from the left) of that expression as x → 1− equals 2 (because the fraction simplifies to x+1 for x ≠ 1). So you could say the left-hand limit exists and equals 2, but f(1) is undefined — the function is not continuous at 1 unless you define f(1) = 2.\n\nWould you like to try a short example where the formula is undefined at the endpoint so you can apply these steps?\n\n## Concepts Potentially Explained\n[\n  \"IU1: Piecewise Function Definition\",\n  \"IU2: Continuity of Functions\",\n  \"IU3: Evaluating Piecewise Functions at Specific Points\"\n]\n\n## User's Previous State for These Concepts\n{\n  \"IU1: Piecewise Function Definition\": {\n    \"state\": \"knows_well\"\n  },\n  \"IU2: Continuity of Functions\": {\n    \"state\": \"knows_well\"\n  },\n  \"IU3: Evaluating Piecewise Functions at Specific Points\": {\n    \"state\": \"knows_well\"\n  }\n}\n\n## Prerequisites and Their Current States\n{\n  \"IU1: Piecewise Function Definition\": [],\n  \"IU2: Continuity of Functions\": [\n    {\n      \"concept\": \"IU1: Piecewise Function Definition\",\n      \"state\": \"knows_well\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"IU3: Evaluating Piecewise Functions at Specific Points\": [\n    {\n      \"concept\": \"IU2: Continuity of Functions\",\n      \"state\": \"knows_well\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n## User's Demonstrated Understanding (from their response)\nThanks — that clarification helped.

Which function values should I compare at x = 2 and x = -2?\n- AI Tutor: Good — you're on the right track by thinking about the boundary points where the formula changes. Continuity at a boundary means the left-hand and right-hand limits (which for piecewise-defined simple formulas are just the function values from the appropriate pieces) agree there and equal the value of the function at that point.\n\nIdentify the two boundary points: x = 2 and x = −2.\n\n1. At x = 2:\n- For x > 2 the expression used is ax + 3, so the right-hand value at 2 is a·2 + 3 = 2a + 3.\n- For −2 ≤ x ≤ 2 the expression used at x = 2 is x − 5, so the value there is 2 − 5 = −3.\nContinuity at x = 2 requires the right-hand value equal the value at 2. Write that equation.\n\n2. At x = −2:\n- For −2 ≤ x ≤ 2 the expression at x = −2 is x − 5, so the value there is −2 − 5 = −7.\n- For x < −2 the expression used is 2x − b, so the left-hand value at −2 is 2(−2) − b = −4 − b.\nContinuity at x = −2 requires the left-hand value equal the value at −2. Write that equation.\n\nNow you have two equations in a and b. What are those equations? Solve them for a and b, then compute a + b. If you want, tell me the equations you wrote and your steps to solve them and I’ll check your work.\n- You: Okay — the equations I get are 2a + 3 = −3 (from x = 2) and −4 − b = −7 (from x = −2). Can you confirm those are set up correctly? Also, could you show the algebra to solve each for a and b and then compute a + b?\n- AI Tutor: You're correct about the two equations — those come from setting the appropriate piecewise expressions equal at the boundary points. Now try solving each equation step by step; I'll guide you and check your work.\n\nStart with 2a + 3 = −3. Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the 2a term: what do you get next? \n\nThen move to −4 − b = −7. Add 4 to both sides to isolate −b: what does that give you, and what is b after you multiply or change sign?\n\nAfter you find a and b, add them to get a + b. Tell me the values you obtain and I'll confirm.\n- You: After solving, a = −3 and b = 3, so a + b = 0.\n- AI Tutor: Exactly right. Quick check of your steps:\n\n- From 2a + 3 = −3: subtract 3 to get 2a = −6, so a = −3.\n- From −4 − b = −7: add 4 to get −b = −3, so b = 3.\n- Then a + b = −3 + 3 = 0.\n\nEverything is correct. Nicely done.\n- You: Thanks — that explanation helped. One quick question: when deciding which piece to use for the left- or right-hand value at a boundary, is the rule always \"use the piece valid for x just less than the boundary for the left-hand limit, and the piece valid for x just greater than the boundary for the right-hand limit\"? Just want to be sure I apply that correctly on future piecewise problems.\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that rule is exactly right and is the general way to handle piecewise functions at boundary points.\n\nMore precisely:\n- The left-hand limit at a point x = c uses the formula that applies for x values slightly less than c (the piece covering values just to the left of c).\n- The right-hand limit at x = c uses the formula that applies for x values slightly greater than c (the piece covering values just to the right of c).\n- If the function is defined at c, its actual value f(c) may come from one of the pieces (depending on how the piecewise definition specifies the intervals). For continuity you need left-hand limit = right-hand limit = f(c).\n\nA couple of quick reminders:\n- Pay attention to whether the interval endpoints in the piecewise definition are included (≤ or ≥) or excluded (< or >). That tells you which piece gives f(c) itself.\n- Even if f(c) is defined by only one piece, both one-sided limits must still match that value for continuity.\n- If one-sided limits differ, the function has a jump discontinuity at c.\n\nIf you want, I can give a short example with different endpoint inclusions so you can practice identifying which piece to use for left, right, and f(c). Which would you prefer?\n- You: Thanks — that makes sense and I see how to pick the pieces for left and right limits now. Quick follow-up: if the piecewise definition uses strict inequalities on both sides (so f(c) isn't defined by either piece), we still just compare the left- and right-hand expressions — do we then say the function is discontinuous at c unless those two one-sided limits happen to be equal? Is that the right way to state it?\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that's exactly right. If f(c) is not defined (because neither piece includes x = c), then for continuity at c you'd need both one-sided limits to exist and be equal; only then could you extend f to be continuous there by defining f(c) equal to that common value. If the left- and right-hand limits are different (or one/both fail to exist), the function has a discontinuity at c and you cannot make it continuous at c without changing the function.\n\nMore compactly:\n- If f(c) is defined: continuity at c requires left-hand limit = right-hand limit = f(c).\n- If f(c) is not defined: continuity at c would require left-hand limit = right-hand limit (and then you could define f(c) to be that common value to make it continuous). If the one-sided limits differ, the point is a jump discontinuity.\n\nGood thinking — do you want an example where f(c) isn't defined so you can practice deciding whether the limits match?\n- You: Thanks — that cleared it up. One quick thing I'd like to confirm: when checking continuity at a boundary I should first note which inequalities include the endpoint (≤ or ≥) to identify f(c) if it’s defined, then independently pick the piece for x<c for the left-hand limit and the piece for x>c for the right-hand limit, and finally compare left, right, and f(c) (if present). Is that the complete checklist I should use every time?\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that checklist is complete and a reliable procedure to follow every time. In summary, when checking continuity at a boundary point c:\n\n1. Check whether f(c) is defined by looking at the interval endpoints (≤ / ≥ vs < / >). If included, determine f(c) from the piece that contains c.\n2. For the left-hand limit, use the formula that applies for x values just less than c (the piece covering x < c near c).\n3. For the right-hand limit, use the formula that applies for x values just greater than c (the piece covering x > c near c).\n4. Compare:\n   - If f(c) is defined: require left-hand limit = right-hand limit = f(c).\n   - If f(c) is not defined: require left-hand limit = right-hand limit in order for the function to be extendable to a continuous function at c; otherwise it's discontinuous.\n\nExtra tips:\n- Watch endpoint inclusions carefully — they determine which piece gives f(c).\n- You can compute the one-sided limits by directly substituting c into the corresponding formulas when those formulas are polynomials/linear (or otherwise continuous on their intervals).\n- If either one-sided limit does not exist, the function is discontinuous at c.\n\nWould you like a quick example to practice this checklist?\n- You: Thanks — that checklist makes sense and I see how to apply it. One question: if the boundary point is also the domain endpoint (so only one side of x exists in the domain), do I treat the absent side as \"not applicable\" or do I still require the existing one-sided limit to equal f(c) for continuity at that endpoint?\n- AI Tutor: Good question — endpoints of the domain are a special but simple case.\n\nIf c is an endpoint of the domain (so values only exist on one side of c), you treat the missing one-sided limit as not applicable. Continuity at c then requires that the one existing one-sided limit equals f(c).\n\nMore concretely:\n- If the domain includes values only for x ≥ c (left endpoint), check the right-hand limit lim_{x→c+} f(x). If f(c) is defined, continuity at c means lim_{x→c+} f(x) = f(c). (The left-hand limit lim_{x→c-} is not applicable.)\n- If the domain includes values only for x ≤ c (right endpoint), check the left-hand limit lim_{x→c-} f(x). Continuity at c means lim_{x→c-} f(x) = f(c). (The right-hand limit is not applicable.)\n\nIn short: at a domain endpoint you only require the one relevant one-sided limit to match f(c). If f(c) is not defined, you cannot have continuity at that endpoint (unless you extend the function by defining f(c) equal to the existing one-sided limit). \n\nWould you like a quick example of checking continuity at a domain endpoint?\n- You: Thanks — that clarification helped. I see that at a domain endpoint I only need the existing one-sided limit to match f(c). One quick follow-up: if the endpoint is included in a piecewise definition but the formula there is something like a fraction that becomes undefined at c (so f(c) isn't actually defined even though the inequality includes c), do we treat that the same as \"f(c) not defined\" and therefore say it's discontinuous unless the one-sided limit exists and we redefine f(c)? In other words, inclusion by the interval doesn't override the function being undefined at that point — right?\n- AI Tutor: Right — inclusion by the interval does not override the actual formula failing to produce a value at that point. If the piece that \"contains\" c has a formula that is undefined at c (like a division by zero, a logarithm of a nonpositive number, etc.), then f(c) is not defined in practice, even if the interval symbol includes c. You should treat that the same as any other point where f(c) is not defined.\n\nSo you proceed this way:\n- First check whether the formula for the piece that supposedly defines f(c) actually yields a finite value at c. If it does, that is f(c).\n- If the formula is undefined at c, then f(c) is not defined (unless the problem explicitly states some defined value at c).\n- For continuity:\n  - If f(c) is defined, require the relevant one-sided limits equal f(c) (or both one-sided limits equal f(c) if c is an interior point).\n  - If f(c) is not defined, continuity at c would require the one-sided limits (the ones that make sense given the domain) to exist and be equal; then you could define f(c) to be that common limit to make the function continuous there. If the one-sided limits do not agree (or don't exist), the point is a discontinuity.\n\nExample to keep in mind: Suppose a piece is defined as (x^2 − 1)/(x − 1) for x ≤ 1. The algebraic expression is undefined at x = 1, even though the interval includes 1. You should note f(1) is not defined unless the definition separately specifies a value at 1. However, the one-sided limit (from the left) of that expression as x → 1− equals 2 (because the fraction simplifies to x+1 for x ≠ 1). So you could say the left-hand limit exists and equals 2, but f(1) is undefined — the function is not continuous at 1 unless you define f(1) = 2.\n\nWould you like to try a short example where the formula is undefined at the endpoint so you can apply these steps?\n\n# Your Message Style\n## Interaction Style\n- Length of User Message: The user's query/response is always around 20 words.\n\n# Task\nGenerate your next message following these rules:\n1.

Which function values should I compare at x = 2 and x = -2?\n- AI Tutor: Good — you're on the right track by thinking about the boundary points where the formula changes. Continuity at a boundary means the left-hand and right-hand limits (which for piecewise-defined simple formulas are just the function values from the appropriate pieces) agree there and equal the value of the function at that point.\n\nIdentify the two boundary points: x = 2 and x = −2.\n\n1. At x = 2:\n- For x > 2 the expression used is ax + 3, so the right-hand value at 2 is a·2 + 3 = 2a + 3.\n- For −2 ≤ x ≤ 2 the expression used at x = 2 is x − 5, so the value there is 2 − 5 = −3.\nContinuity at x = 2 requires the right-hand value equal the value at 2. Write that equation.\n\n2. At x = −2:\n- For −2 ≤ x ≤ 2 the expression at x = −2 is x − 5, so the value there is −2 − 5 = −7.\n- For x < −2 the expression used is 2x − b, so the left-hand value at −2 is 2(−2) − b = −4 − b.\nContinuity at x = −2 requires the left-hand value equal the value at −2. Write that equation.\n\nNow you have two equations in a and b. What are those equations? Solve them for a and b, then compute a + b. If you want, tell me the equations you wrote and your steps to solve them and I’ll check your work.\n- You: Okay — the equations I get are 2a + 3 = −3 (from x = 2) and −4 − b = −7 (from x = −2). Can you confirm those are set up correctly? Also, could you show the algebra to solve each for a and b and then compute a + b?\n- AI Tutor: You're correct about the two equations — those come from setting the appropriate piecewise expressions equal at the boundary points. Now try solving each equation step by step; I'll guide you and check your work.\n\nStart with 2a + 3 = −3. Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the 2a term: what do you get next? \n\nThen move to −4 − b = −7. Add 4 to both sides to isolate −b: what does that give you, and what is b after you multiply or change sign?\n\nAfter you find a and b, add them to get a + b. Tell me the values you obtain and I'll confirm.\n- You: After solving, a = −3 and b = 3, so a + b = 0.\n- AI Tutor: Exactly right. Quick check of your steps:\n\n- From 2a + 3 = −3: subtract 3 to get 2a = −6, so a = −3.\n- From −4 − b = −7: add 4 to get −b = −3, so b = 3.\n- Then a + b = −3 + 3 = 0.\n\nEverything is correct. Nicely done.\n- You: Thanks — that explanation helped. One quick question: when deciding which piece to use for the left- or right-hand value at a boundary, is the rule always \"use the piece valid for x just less than the boundary for the left-hand limit, and the piece valid for x just greater than the boundary for the right-hand limit\"? Just want to be sure I apply that correctly on future piecewise problems.\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that rule is exactly right and is the general way to handle piecewise functions at boundary points.\n\nMore precisely:\n- The left-hand limit at a point x = c uses the formula that applies for x values slightly less than c (the piece covering values just to the left of c).\n- The right-hand limit at x = c uses the formula that applies for x values slightly greater than c (the piece covering values just to the right of c).\n- If the function is defined at c, its actual value f(c) may come from one of the pieces (depending on how the piecewise definition specifies the intervals). For continuity you need left-hand limit = right-hand limit = f(c).\n\nA couple of quick reminders:\n- Pay attention to whether the interval endpoints in the piecewise definition are included (≤ or ≥) or excluded (< or >). That tells you which piece gives f(c) itself.\n- Even if f(c) is defined by only one piece, both one-sided limits must still match that value for continuity.\n- If one-sided limits differ, the function has a jump discontinuity at c.\n\nIf you want, I can give a short example with different endpoint inclusions so you can practice identifying which piece to use for left, right, and f(c). Which would you prefer?\n- You: Thanks — that makes sense and I see how to pick the pieces for left and right limits now. Quick follow-up: if the piecewise definition uses strict inequalities on both sides (so f(c) isn't defined by either piece), we still just compare the left- and right-hand expressions — do we then say the function is discontinuous at c unless those two one-sided limits happen to be equal? Is that the right way to state it?\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that's exactly right. If f(c) is not defined (because neither piece includes x = c), then for continuity at c you'd need both one-sided limits to exist and be equal; only then could you extend f to be continuous there by defining f(c) equal to that common value. If the left- and right-hand limits are different (or one/both fail to exist), the function has a discontinuity at c and you cannot make it continuous at c without changing the function.\n\nMore compactly:\n- If f(c) is defined: continuity at c requires left-hand limit = right-hand limit = f(c).\n- If f(c) is not defined: continuity at c would require left-hand limit = right-hand limit (and then you could define f(c) to be that common value to make it continuous). If the one-sided limits differ, the point is a jump discontinuity.\n\nGood thinking — do you want an example where f(c) isn't defined so you can practice deciding whether the limits match?\n- You: Thanks — that cleared it up. One quick thing I'd like to confirm: when checking continuity at a boundary I should first note which inequalities include the endpoint (≤ or ≥) to identify f(c) if it’s defined, then independently pick the piece for x<c for the left-hand limit and the piece for x>c for the right-hand limit, and finally compare left, right, and f(c) (if present). Is that the complete checklist I should use every time?\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that checklist is complete and a reliable procedure to follow every time. In summary, when checking continuity at a boundary point c:\n\n1. Check whether f(c) is defined by looking at the interval endpoints (≤ / ≥ vs < / >). If included, determine f(c) from the piece that contains c.\n2. For the left-hand limit, use the formula that applies for x values just less than c (the piece covering x < c near c).\n3. For the right-hand limit, use the formula that applies for x values just greater than c (the piece covering x > c near c).\n4. Compare:\n   - If f(c) is defined: require left-hand limit = right-hand limit = f(c).\n   - If f(c) is not defined: require left-hand limit = right-hand limit in order for the function to be extendable to a continuous function at c; otherwise it's discontinuous.\n\nExtra tips:\n- Watch endpoint inclusions carefully — they determine which piece gives f(c).\n- You can compute the one-sided limits by directly substituting c into the corresponding formulas when those formulas are polynomials/linear (or otherwise continuous on their intervals).\n- If either one-sided limit does not exist, the function is discontinuous at c.\n\nWould you like a quick example to practice this checklist?\n- You: Thanks — that checklist makes sense and I see how to apply it. One question: if the boundary point is also the domain endpoint (so only one side of x exists in the domain), do I treat the absent side as \"not applicable\" or do I still require the existing one-sided limit to equal f(c) for continuity at that endpoint?\n- AI Tutor: Good question — endpoints of the domain are a special but simple case.\n\nIf c is an endpoint of the domain (so values only exist on one side of c), you treat the missing one-sided limit as not applicable. Continuity at c then requires that the one existing one-sided limit equals f(c).\n\nMore concretely:\n- If the domain includes values only for x ≥ c (left endpoint), check the right-hand limit lim_{x→c+} f(x). If f(c) is defined, continuity at c means lim_{x→c+} f(x) = f(c). (The left-hand limit lim_{x→c-} is not applicable.)\n- If the domain includes values only for x ≤ c (right endpoint), check the left-hand limit lim_{x→c-} f(x). Continuity at c means lim_{x→c-} f(x) = f(c). (The right-hand limit is not applicable.)\n\nIn short: at a domain endpoint you only require the one relevant one-sided limit to match f(c).

Compare:\n   - If f(c) is defined: require left-hand limit = right-hand limit = f(c).\n   - If f(c) is not defined: require left-hand limit = right-hand limit in order for the function to be extendable to a continuous function at c; otherwise it's discontinuous.\n\nExtra tips:\n- Watch endpoint inclusions carefully — they determine which piece gives f(c).\n- You can compute the one-sided limits by directly substituting c into the corresponding formulas when those formulas are polynomials/linear (or otherwise continuous on their intervals).\n- If either one-sided limit does not exist, the function is discontinuous at c.\n\nWould you like a quick example to practice this checklist?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thanks — that checklist makes sense and I see how to apply it. One question: if the boundary point is also the domain endpoint (so only one side of x exists in the domain), do I treat the absent side as \"not applicable\" or do I still require the existing one-sided limit to equal f(c) for continuity at that endpoint?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Good question — endpoints of the domain are a special but simple case.\n\nIf c is an endpoint of the domain (so values only exist on one side of c), you treat the missing one-sided limit as not applicable. Continuity at c then requires that the one existing one-sided limit equals f(c).\n\nMore concretely:\n- If the domain includes values only for x ≥ c (left endpoint), check the right-hand limit lim_{x→c+} f(x). If f(c) is defined, continuity at c means lim_{x→c+} f(x) = f(c). (The left-hand limit lim_{x→c-} is not applicable.)\n- If the domain includes values only for x ≤ c (right endpoint), check the left-hand limit lim_{x→c-} f(x). Continuity at c means lim_{x→c-} f(x) = f(c). (The right-hand limit is not applicable.)\n\nIn short: at a domain endpoint you only require the one relevant one-sided limit to match f(c). If f(c) is not defined, you cannot have continuity at that endpoint (unless you extend the function by defining f(c) equal to the existing one-sided limit). \n\nWould you like a quick example of checking continuity at a domain endpoint?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thanks — that clarification helped. I see that at a domain endpoint I only need the existing one-sided limit to match f(c). One quick follow-up: if the endpoint is included in a piecewise definition but the formula there is something like a fraction that becomes undefined at c (so f(c) isn't actually defined even though the inequality includes c), do we treat that the same as \"f(c) not defined\" and therefore say it's discontinuous unless the one-sided limit exists and we redefine f(c)? In other words, inclusion by the interval doesn't override the function being undefined at that point — right?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Right — inclusion by the interval does not override the actual formula failing to produce a value at that point. If the piece that \"contains\" c has a formula that is undefined at c (like a division by zero, a logarithm of a nonpositive number, etc.), then f(c) is not defined in practice, even if the interval symbol includes c. You should treat that the same as any other point where f(c) is not defined.\n\nSo you proceed this way:\n- First check whether the formula for the piece that supposedly defines f(c) actually yields a finite value at c. If it does, that is f(c).\n- If the formula is undefined at c, then f(c) is not defined (unless the problem explicitly states some defined value at c).\n- For continuity:\n  - If f(c) is defined, require the relevant one-sided limits equal f(c) (or both one-sided limits equal f(c) if c is an interior point).\n  - If f(c) is not defined, continuity at c would require the one-sided limits (the ones that make sense given the domain) to exist and be equal; then you could define f(c) to be that common limit to make the function continuous there. If the one-sided limits do not agree (or don't exist), the point is a discontinuity.\n\nExample to keep in mind: Suppose a piece is defined as (x^2 − 1)/(x − 1) for x ≤ 1. The algebraic expression is undefined at x = 1, even though the interval includes 1. You should note f(1) is not defined unless the definition separately specifies a value at 1. However, the one-sided limit (from the left) of that expression as x → 1− equals 2 (because the fraction simplifies to x+1 for x ≠ 1). So you could say the left-hand limit exists and equals 2, but f(1) is undefined — the function is not continuous at 1 unless you define f(1) = 2.\n\nWould you like to try a short example where the formula is undefined at the endpoint so you can apply these steps?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thanks — that clarification really helped. One quick question: when a formula is undefined at c but the one-sided limits both exist and are equal (a removable discontinuity), is it correct that we say the original function is discontinuous at c but can be made continuous by defining f(c) equal to that common limit? And in practice, when solving for unknown constants to enforce continuity across a boundary, I can treat f(c) as “not defined” initially and instead set the left- and right-hand expressions equal to each other (ignoring f(c)) to get the equation. Is that the right procedure every time in removable-discontinuity cases?"}], "output": ["Yes — that's all correct. A few precise points to keep your understanding exact:\n\n- If the formula at c is undefined (so f(c) is not actually a value), then the function as written is discontinuous at c, even if both one-sided limits exist and are equal. That kind of discontinuity is called removable because you can \"remove\" it by defining f(c) to be the common limit.\n\n- In solving for unknown constants to enforce continuity at a boundary where the function currently has no defined value at c, the right procedure is exactly what you described: require the left-hand limit and right-hand limit to be equal. Concretely, pick the piece valid for x < c, evaluate its formula as x → c− (usually by direct substitution if it's a polynomial/rational expression that's defined at c), pick the piece valid for x > c and evaluate as x → c+, and set those two expressions equal.

A few precise points to keep your understanding exact:\n\n- If the formula at c is undefined (so f(c) is not actually a value), then the function as written is discontinuous at c, even if both one-sided limits exist and are equal. That kind of discontinuity is called removable because you can \"remove\" it by defining f(c) to be the common limit.\n\n- In solving for unknown constants to enforce continuity at a boundary where the function currently has no defined value at c, the right procedure is exactly what you described: require the left-hand limit and right-hand limit to be equal. Concretely, pick the piece valid for x < c, evaluate its formula as x → c− (usually by direct substitution if it's a polynomial/rational expression that's defined at c), pick the piece valid for x > c and evaluate as x → c+, and set those two expressions equal. Solve for the unknown(s). After that, defining f(c) to be that common value yields a continuous function at c.\n\n- If f(c) is defined but the formula gives an indeterminate/undefined expression at c, treat f(c) as not defined (unless the problem explicitly gives a value) and follow the same approach above.\n\n- Small caution: when dealing with rational expressions that simplify to a continuous expression except at c, you can often simplify first (noting equivalence for x ≠ c) and then substitute the limit value; but remember that simplification doesn't retroactively define f(c). You still must check and (if required) specify f(c).\n\nWould you like to practice this with a short example where you solve for a constant that removes a discontinuity?\n\n# Conversation History\n- You: How do I use continuity at the boundary points to create equations for a and b? Which function values should I compare at x = 2 and x = -2?\n- AI Tutor: Good — you're on the right track by thinking about the boundary points where the formula changes. Continuity at a boundary means the left-hand and right-hand limits (which for piecewise-defined simple formulas are just the function values from the appropriate pieces) agree there and equal the value of the function at that point.\n\nIdentify the two boundary points: x = 2 and x = −2.\n\n1. At x = 2:\n- For x > 2 the expression used is ax + 3, so the right-hand value at 2 is a·2 + 3 = 2a + 3.\n- For −2 ≤ x ≤ 2 the expression used at x = 2 is x − 5, so the value there is 2 − 5 = −3.\nContinuity at x = 2 requires the right-hand value equal the value at 2. Write that equation.\n\n2. At x = −2:\n- For −2 ≤ x ≤ 2 the expression at x = −2 is x − 5, so the value there is −2 − 5 = −7.\n- For x < −2 the expression used is 2x − b, so the left-hand value at −2 is 2(−2) − b = −4 − b.\nContinuity at x = −2 requires the left-hand value equal the value at −2. Write that equation.\n\nNow you have two equations in a and b. What are those equations? Solve them for a and b, then compute a + b. If you want, tell me the equations you wrote and your steps to solve them and I’ll check your work.\n- You: Okay — the equations I get are 2a + 3 = −3 (from x = 2) and −4 − b = −7 (from x = −2). Can you confirm those are set up correctly? Also, could you show the algebra to solve each for a and b and then compute a + b?\n- AI Tutor: You're correct about the two equations — those come from setting the appropriate piecewise expressions equal at the boundary points. Now try solving each equation step by step; I'll guide you and check your work.\n\nStart with 2a + 3 = −3. Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the 2a term: what do you get next? \n\nThen move to −4 − b = −7. Add 4 to both sides to isolate −b: what does that give you, and what is b after you multiply or change sign?\n\nAfter you find a and b, add them to get a + b. Tell me the values you obtain and I'll confirm.\n- You: After solving, a = −3 and b = 3, so a + b = 0.\n- AI Tutor: Exactly right. Quick check of your steps:\n\n- From 2a + 3 = −3: subtract 3 to get 2a = −6, so a = −3.\n- From −4 − b = −7: add 4 to get −b = −3, so b = 3.\n- Then a + b = −3 + 3 = 0.\n\nEverything is correct. Nicely done.\n- You: Thanks — that explanation helped. One quick question: when deciding which piece to use for the left- or right-hand value at a boundary, is the rule always \"use the piece valid for x just less than the boundary for the left-hand limit, and the piece valid for x just greater than the boundary for the right-hand limit\"? Just want to be sure I apply that correctly on future piecewise problems.\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that rule is exactly right and is the general way to handle piecewise functions at boundary points.\n\nMore precisely:\n- The left-hand limit at a point x = c uses the formula that applies for x values slightly less than c (the piece covering values just to the left of c).\n- The right-hand limit at x = c uses the formula that applies for x values slightly greater than c (the piece covering values just to the right of c).\n- If the function is defined at c, its actual value f(c) may come from one of the pieces (depending on how the piecewise definition specifies the intervals). For continuity you need left-hand limit = right-hand limit = f(c).\n\nA couple of quick reminders:\n- Pay attention to whether the interval endpoints in the piecewise definition are included (≤ or ≥) or excluded (< or >). That tells you which piece gives f(c) itself.\n- Even if f(c) is defined by only one piece, both one-sided limits must still match that value for continuity.\n- If one-sided limits differ, the function has a jump discontinuity at c.\n\nIf you want, I can give a short example with different endpoint inclusions so you can practice identifying which piece to use for left, right, and f(c). Which would you prefer?\n- You: Thanks — that makes sense and I see how to pick the pieces for left and right limits now. Quick follow-up: if the piecewise definition uses strict inequalities on both sides (so f(c) isn't defined by either piece), we still just compare the left- and right-hand expressions — do we then say the function is discontinuous at c unless those two one-sided limits happen to be equal? Is that the right way to state it?\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that's exactly right. If f(c) is not defined (because neither piece includes x = c), then for continuity at c you'd need both one-sided limits to exist and be equal; only then could you extend f to be continuous there by defining f(c) equal to that common value. If the left- and right-hand limits are different (or one/both fail to exist), the function has a discontinuity at c and you cannot make it continuous at c without changing the function.\n\nMore compactly:\n- If f(c) is defined: continuity at c requires left-hand limit = right-hand limit = f(c).\n- If f(c) is not defined: continuity at c would require left-hand limit = right-hand limit (and then you could define f(c) to be that common value to make it continuous). If the one-sided limits differ, the point is a jump discontinuity.\n\nGood thinking — do you want an example where f(c) isn't defined so you can practice deciding whether the limits match?\n- You: Thanks — that cleared it up. One quick thing I'd like to confirm: when checking continuity at a boundary I should first note which inequalities include the endpoint (≤ or ≥) to identify f(c) if it’s defined, then independently pick the piece for x<c for the left-hand limit and the piece for x>c for the right-hand limit, and finally compare left, right, and f(c) (if present). Is that the complete checklist I should use every time?\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that checklist is complete and a reliable procedure to follow every time. In summary, when checking continuity at a boundary point c:\n\n1. Check whether f(c) is defined by looking at the interval endpoints (≤ / ≥ vs < / >). If included, determine f(c) from the piece that contains c.\n2. For the left-hand limit, use the formula that applies for x values just less than c (the piece covering x < c near c).\n3. For the right-hand limit, use the formula that applies for x values just greater than c (the piece covering x > c near c).\n4. Compare:\n   - If f(c) is defined: require left-hand limit = right-hand limit = f(c).\n   - If f(c) is not defined: require left-hand limit = right-hand limit in order for the function to be extendable to a continuous function at c; otherwise it's discontinuous.\n\nExtra tips:\n- Watch endpoint inclusions carefully — they determine which piece gives f(c).\n- You can compute the one-sided limits by directly substituting c into the corresponding formulas when those formulas are polynomials/linear (or otherwise continuous on their intervals).\n- If either one-sided limit does not exist, the function is discontinuous at c.\n\nWould you like a quick example to practice this checklist?\n- You: Thanks — that checklist makes sense and I see how to apply it. One question: if the boundary point is also the domain endpoint (so only one side of x exists in the domain), do I treat the absent side as \"not applicable\" or do I still require the existing one-sided limit to equal f(c) for continuity at that endpoint?\n- AI Tutor: Good question — endpoints of the domain are a special but simple case.\n\nIf c is an endpoint of the domain (so values only exist on one side of c), you treat the missing one-sided limit as not applicable. Continuity at c then requires that the one existing one-sided limit equals f(c).\n\nMore concretely:\n- If the domain includes values only for x ≥ c (left endpoint), check the right-hand limit lim_{x→c+} f(x). If f(c) is defined, continuity at c means lim_{x→c+} f(x) = f(c). (The left-hand limit lim_{x→c-} is not applicable.)\n- If the domain includes values only for x ≤ c (right endpoint), check the left-hand limit lim_{x→c-} f(x). Continuity at c means lim_{x→c-} f(x) = f(c). (The right-hand limit is not applicable.)\n\nIn short: at a domain endpoint you only require the one relevant one-sided limit to match f(c). If f(c) is not defined, you cannot have continuity at that endpoint (unless you extend the function by defining f(c) equal to the existing one-sided limit). \n\nWould you like a quick example of checking continuity at a domain endpoint?\n- You: Thanks — that clarification helped. I see that at a domain endpoint I only need the existing one-sided limit to match f(c). One quick follow-up: if the endpoint is included in a piecewise definition but the formula there is something like a fraction that becomes undefined at c (so f(c) isn't actually defined even though the inequality includes c), do we treat that the same as \"f(c) not defined\" and therefore say it's discontinuous unless the one-sided limit exists and we redefine f(c)? In other words, inclusion by the interval doesn't override the function being undefined at that point — right?\n- AI Tutor: Right — inclusion by the interval does not override the actual formula failing to produce a value at that point. If the piece that \"contains\" c has a formula that is undefined at c (like a division by zero, a logarithm of a nonpositive number, etc.), then f(c) is not defined in practice, even if the interval symbol includes c. You should treat that the same as any other point where f(c) is not defined.\n\nSo you proceed this way:\n- First check whether the formula for the piece that supposedly defines f(c) actually yields a finite value at c. If it does, that is f(c).\n- If the formula is undefined at c, then f(c) is not defined (unless the problem explicitly states some defined value at c).\n- For continuity:\n  - If f(c) is defined, require the relevant one-sided limits equal f(c) (or both one-sided limits equal f(c) if c is an interior point).\n  - If f(c) is not defined, continuity at c would require the one-sided limits (the ones that make sense given the domain) to exist and be equal; then you could define f(c) to be that common limit to make the function continuous there. If the one-sided limits do not agree (or don't exist), the point is a discontinuity.\n\nExample to keep in mind: Suppose a piece is defined as (x^2 − 1)/(x − 1) for x ≤ 1. The algebraic expression is undefined at x = 1, even though the interval includes 1. You should note f(1) is not defined unless the definition separately specifies a value at 1. However, the one-sided limit (from the left) of that expression as x → 1− equals 2 (because the fraction simplifies to x+1 for x ≠ 1). So you could say the left-hand limit exists and equals 2, but f(1) is undefined — the function is not continuous at 1 unless you define f(1) = 2.\n\nWould you like to try a short example where the formula is undefined at the endpoint so you can apply these steps?\n- You: Thanks — that clarification really helped. One quick question: when a formula is undefined at c but the one-sided limits both exist and are equal (a removable discontinuity), is it correct that we say the original function is discontinuous at c but can be made continuous by defining f(c) equal to that common limit? And in practice, when solving for unknown constants to enforce continuity across a boundary, I can treat f(c) as “not defined” initially and instead set the left- and right-hand expressions equal to each other (ignoring f(c)) to get the equation. Is that the right procedure every time in removable-discontinuity cases?\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that's all correct. A few precise points to keep your understanding exact:\n\n- If the formula at c is undefined (so f(c) is not actually a value), then the function as written is discontinuous at c, even if both one-sided limits exist and are equal. That kind of discontinuity is called removable because you can \"remove\" it by defining f(c) to be the common limit.\n\n- In solving for unknown constants to enforce continuity at a boundary where the function currently has no defined value at c, the right procedure is exactly what you described: require the left-hand limit and right-hand limit to be equal.

You still must check and (if required) specify f(c).\n\nWould you like to practice this with a short example where you solve for a constant that removes a discontinuity?\n\n# Your Message Style\n## Interaction Style\n- Length of User Message: The user's query/response is always around 20 words.\n\n# Task\nGenerate your next message following these rules:\n1.

Is that the complete checklist I should use every time?\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that checklist is complete and a reliable procedure to follow every time. In summary, when checking continuity at a boundary point c:\n\n1. Check whether f(c) is defined by looking at the interval endpoints (≤ / ≥ vs < / >). If included, determine f(c) from the piece that contains c.\n2. For the left-hand limit, use the formula that applies for x values just less than c (the piece covering x < c near c).\n3. For the right-hand limit, use the formula that applies for x values just greater than c (the piece covering x > c near c).\n4. Compare:\n   - If f(c) is defined: require left-hand limit = right-hand limit = f(c).\n   - If f(c) is not defined: require left-hand limit = right-hand limit in order for the function to be extendable to a continuous function at c; otherwise it's discontinuous.\n\nExtra tips:\n- Watch endpoint inclusions carefully — they determine which piece gives f(c).\n- You can compute the one-sided limits by directly substituting c into the corresponding formulas when those formulas are polynomials/linear (or otherwise continuous on their intervals).\n- If either one-sided limit does not exist, the function is discontinuous at c.\n\nWould you like a quick example to practice this checklist?\n- You: Thanks — that checklist makes sense and I see how to apply it. One question: if the boundary point is also the domain endpoint (so only one side of x exists in the domain), do I treat the absent side as \"not applicable\" or do I still require the existing one-sided limit to equal f(c) for continuity at that endpoint?\n- AI Tutor: Good question — endpoints of the domain are a special but simple case.\n\nIf c is an endpoint of the domain (so values only exist on one side of c), you treat the missing one-sided limit as not applicable. Continuity at c then requires that the one existing one-sided limit equals f(c).\n\nMore concretely:\n- If the domain includes values only for x ≥ c (left endpoint), check the right-hand limit lim_{x→c+} f(x). If f(c) is defined, continuity at c means lim_{x→c+} f(x) = f(c). (The left-hand limit lim_{x→c-} is not applicable.)\n- If the domain includes values only for x ≤ c (right endpoint), check the left-hand limit lim_{x→c-} f(x). Continuity at c means lim_{x→c-} f(x) = f(c). (The right-hand limit is not applicable.)\n\nIn short: at a domain endpoint you only require the one relevant one-sided limit to match f(c). If f(c) is not defined, you cannot have continuity at that endpoint (unless you extend the function by defining f(c) equal to the existing one-sided limit). \n\nWould you like a quick example of checking continuity at a domain endpoint?\n- You: Thanks — that clarification helped. I see that at a domain endpoint I only need the existing one-sided limit to match f(c). One quick follow-up: if the endpoint is included in a piecewise definition but the formula there is something like a fraction that becomes undefined at c (so f(c) isn't actually defined even though the inequality includes c), do we treat that the same as \"f(c) not defined\" and therefore say it's discontinuous unless the one-sided limit exists and we redefine f(c)? In other words, inclusion by the interval doesn't override the function being undefined at that point — right?\n- AI Tutor: Right — inclusion by the interval does not override the actual formula failing to produce a value at that point. If the piece that \"contains\" c has a formula that is undefined at c (like a division by zero, a logarithm of a nonpositive number, etc.), then f(c) is not defined in practice, even if the interval symbol includes c. You should treat that the same as any other point where f(c) is not defined.\n\nSo you proceed this way:\n- First check whether the formula for the piece that supposedly defines f(c) actually yields a finite value at c. If it does, that is f(c).\n- If the formula is undefined at c, then f(c) is not defined (unless the problem explicitly states some defined value at c).\n- For continuity:\n  - If f(c) is defined, require the relevant one-sided limits equal f(c) (or both one-sided limits equal f(c) if c is an interior point).\n  - If f(c) is not defined, continuity at c would require the one-sided limits (the ones that make sense given the domain) to exist and be equal; then you could define f(c) to be that common limit to make the function continuous there. If the one-sided limits do not agree (or don't exist), the point is a discontinuity.\n\nExample to keep in mind: Suppose a piece is defined as (x^2 − 1)/(x − 1) for x ≤ 1. The algebraic expression is undefined at x = 1, even though the interval includes 1. You should note f(1) is not defined unless the definition separately specifies a value at 1. However, the one-sided limit (from the left) of that expression as x → 1− equals 2 (because the fraction simplifies to x+1 for x ≠ 1). So you could say the left-hand limit exists and equals 2, but f(1) is undefined — the function is not continuous at 1 unless you define f(1) = 2.\n\nWould you like to try a short example where the formula is undefined at the endpoint so you can apply these steps?\n- You: Thanks — that clarification really helped. One quick question: when a formula is undefined at c but the one-sided limits both exist and are equal (a removable discontinuity), is it correct that we say the original function is discontinuous at c but can be made continuous by defining f(c) equal to that common limit? And in practice, when solving for unknown constants to enforce continuity across a boundary, I can treat f(c) as “not defined” initially and instead set the left- and right-hand expressions equal to each other (ignoring f(c)) to get the equation. Is that the right procedure every time in removable-discontinuity cases?\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that's all correct. A few precise points to keep your understanding exact:\n\n- If the formula at c is undefined (so f(c) is not actually a value), then the function as written is discontinuous at c, even if both one-sided limits exist and are equal. That kind of discontinuity is called removable because you can \"remove\" it by defining f(c) to be the common limit.\n\n- In solving for unknown constants to enforce continuity at a boundary where the function currently has no defined value at c, the right procedure is exactly what you described: require the left-hand limit and right-hand limit to be equal. Concretely, pick the piece valid for x < c, evaluate its formula as x → c− (usually by direct substitution if it's a polynomial/rational expression that's defined at c), pick the piece valid for x > c and evaluate as x → c+, and set those two expressions equal. Solve for the unknown(s). After that, defining f(c) to be that common value yields a continuous function at c.\n\n- If f(c) is defined but the formula gives an indeterminate/undefined expression at c, treat f(c) as not defined (unless the problem explicitly gives a value) and follow the same approach above.\n\n- Small caution: when dealing with rational expressions that simplify to a continuous expression except at c, you can often simplify first (noting equivalence for x ≠ c) and then substitute the limit value; but remember that simplification doesn't retroactively define f(c). You still must check and (if required) specify f(c).\n\nWould you like to practice this with a short example where you solve for a constant that removes a discontinuity?\n\n# Your Message Style\n## Interaction Style\n- Length of User Message: The user's query/response is always around 20 words.\n\n# Task\nGenerate your next message following these rules:\n1.

If you are forming algebraic equations to enforce continuity (i.e., setting left-hand limit = right-hand limit), it is safe and often simpler to simplify each expression first (valid for x ≠ c) and then substitute c to get the limit values to equate.

Which function values should I compare at x = 2 and x = -2?\n- AI Tutor: Good — you're on the right track by thinking about the boundary points where the formula changes. Continuity at a boundary means the left-hand and right-hand limits (which for piecewise-defined simple formulas are just the function values from the appropriate pieces) agree there and equal the value of the function at that point.\n\nIdentify the two boundary points: x = 2 and x = −2.\n\n1. At x = 2:\n- For x > 2 the expression used is ax + 3, so the right-hand value at 2 is a·2 + 3 = 2a + 3.\n- For −2 ≤ x ≤ 2 the expression used at x = 2 is x − 5, so the value there is 2 − 5 = −3.\nContinuity at x = 2 requires the right-hand value equal the value at 2. Write that equation.\n\n2. At x = −2:\n- For −2 ≤ x ≤ 2 the expression at x = −2 is x − 5, so the value there is −2 − 5 = −7.\n- For x < −2 the expression used is 2x − b, so the left-hand value at −2 is 2(−2) − b = −4 − b.\nContinuity at x = −2 requires the left-hand value equal the value at −2. Write that equation.\n\nNow you have two equations in a and b. What are those equations? Solve them for a and b, then compute a + b. If you want, tell me the equations you wrote and your steps to solve them and I’ll check your work.\n- You: Okay — the equations I get are 2a + 3 = −3 (from x = 2) and −4 − b = −7 (from x = −2). Can you confirm those are set up correctly? Also, could you show the algebra to solve each for a and b and then compute a + b?\n- AI Tutor: You're correct about the two equations — those come from setting the appropriate piecewise expressions equal at the boundary points. Now try solving each equation step by step; I'll guide you and check your work.\n\nStart with 2a + 3 = −3. Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the 2a term: what do you get next? \n\nThen move to −4 − b = −7. Add 4 to both sides to isolate −b: what does that give you, and what is b after you multiply or change sign?\n\nAfter you find a and b, add them to get a + b. Tell me the values you obtain and I'll confirm.\n- You: After solving, a = −3 and b = 3, so a + b = 0.\n- AI Tutor: Exactly right. Quick check of your steps:\n\n- From 2a + 3 = −3: subtract 3 to get 2a = −6, so a = −3.\n- From −4 − b = −7: add 4 to get −b = −3, so b = 3.\n- Then a + b = −3 + 3 = 0.\n\nEverything is correct. Nicely done.\n- You: Thanks — that explanation helped. One quick question: when deciding which piece to use for the left- or right-hand value at a boundary, is the rule always \"use the piece valid for x just less than the boundary for the left-hand limit, and the piece valid for x just greater than the boundary for the right-hand limit\"? Just want to be sure I apply that correctly on future piecewise problems.\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that rule is exactly right and is the general way to handle piecewise functions at boundary points.\n\nMore precisely:\n- The left-hand limit at a point x = c uses the formula that applies for x values slightly less than c (the piece covering values just to the left of c).\n- The right-hand limit at x = c uses the formula that applies for x values slightly greater than c (the piece covering values just to the right of c).\n- If the function is defined at c, its actual value f(c) may come from one of the pieces (depending on how the piecewise definition specifies the intervals). For continuity you need left-hand limit = right-hand limit = f(c).\n\nA couple of quick reminders:\n- Pay attention to whether the interval endpoints in the piecewise definition are included (≤ or ≥) or excluded (< or >). That tells you which piece gives f(c) itself.\n- Even if f(c) is defined by only one piece, both one-sided limits must still match that value for continuity.\n- If one-sided limits differ, the function has a jump discontinuity at c.\n\nIf you want, I can give a short example with different endpoint inclusions so you can practice identifying which piece to use for left, right, and f(c). Which would you prefer?\n- You: Thanks — that makes sense and I see how to pick the pieces for left and right limits now. Quick follow-up: if the piecewise definition uses strict inequalities on both sides (so f(c) isn't defined by either piece), we still just compare the left- and right-hand expressions — do we then say the function is discontinuous at c unless those two one-sided limits happen to be equal? Is that the right way to state it?\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that's exactly right. If f(c) is not defined (because neither piece includes x = c), then for continuity at c you'd need both one-sided limits to exist and be equal; only then could you extend f to be continuous there by defining f(c) equal to that common value. If the left- and right-hand limits are different (or one/both fail to exist), the function has a discontinuity at c and you cannot make it continuous at c without changing the function.\n\nMore compactly:\n- If f(c) is defined: continuity at c requires left-hand limit = right-hand limit = f(c).\n- If f(c) is not defined: continuity at c would require left-hand limit = right-hand limit (and then you could define f(c) to be that common value to make it continuous). If the one-sided limits differ, the point is a jump discontinuity.\n\nGood thinking — do you want an example where f(c) isn't defined so you can practice deciding whether the limits match?\n- You: Thanks — that cleared it up. One quick thing I'd like to confirm: when checking continuity at a boundary I should first note which inequalities include the endpoint (≤ or ≥) to identify f(c) if it’s defined, then independently pick the piece for x<c for the left-hand limit and the piece for x>c for the right-hand limit, and finally compare left, right, and f(c) (if present). Is that the complete checklist I should use every time?\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that checklist is complete and a reliable procedure to follow every time. In summary, when checking continuity at a boundary point c:\n\n1. Check whether f(c) is defined by looking at the interval endpoints (≤ / ≥ vs < / >). If included, determine f(c) from the piece that contains c.\n2. For the left-hand limit, use the formula that applies for x values just less than c (the piece covering x < c near c).\n3. For the right-hand limit, use the formula that applies for x values just greater than c (the piece covering x > c near c).\n4. Compare:\n   - If f(c) is defined: require left-hand limit = right-hand limit = f(c).\n   - If f(c) is not defined: require left-hand limit = right-hand limit in order for the function to be extendable to a continuous function at c; otherwise it's discontinuous.\n\nExtra tips:\n- Watch endpoint inclusions carefully — they determine which piece gives f(c).\n- You can compute the one-sided limits by directly substituting c into the corresponding formulas when those formulas are polynomials/linear (or otherwise continuous on their intervals).\n- If either one-sided limit does not exist, the function is discontinuous at c.\n\nWould you like a quick example to practice this checklist?\n- You: Thanks — that checklist makes sense and I see how to apply it. One question: if the boundary point is also the domain endpoint (so only one side of x exists in the domain), do I treat the absent side as \"not applicable\" or do I still require the existing one-sided limit to equal f(c) for continuity at that endpoint?\n- AI Tutor: Good question — endpoints of the domain are a special but simple case.\n\nIf c is an endpoint of the domain (so values only exist on one side of c), you treat the missing one-sided limit as not applicable. Continuity at c then requires that the one existing one-sided limit equals f(c).\n\nMore concretely:\n- If the domain includes values only for x ≥ c (left endpoint), check the right-hand limit lim_{x→c+} f(x). If f(c) is defined, continuity at c means lim_{x→c+} f(x) = f(c). (The left-hand limit lim_{x→c-} is not applicable.)\n- If the domain includes values only for x ≤ c (right endpoint), check the left-hand limit lim_{x→c-} f(x). Continuity at c means lim_{x→c-} f(x) = f(c). (The right-hand limit is not applicable.)\n\nIn short: at a domain endpoint you only require the one relevant one-sided limit to match f(c). If f(c) is not defined, you cannot have continuity at that endpoint (unless you extend the function by defining f(c) equal to the existing one-sided limit). \n\nWould you like a quick example of checking continuity at a domain endpoint?\n- You: Thanks — that clarification helped. I see that at a domain endpoint I only need the existing one-sided limit to match f(c). One quick follow-up: if the endpoint is included in a piecewise definition but the formula there is something like a fraction that becomes undefined at c (so f(c) isn't actually defined even though the inequality includes c), do we treat that the same as \"f(c) not defined\" and therefore say it's discontinuous unless the one-sided limit exists and we redefine f(c)? In other words, inclusion by the interval doesn't override the function being undefined at that point — right?\n- AI Tutor: Right — inclusion by the interval does not override the actual formula failing to produce a value at that point. If the piece that \"contains\" c has a formula that is undefined at c (like a division by zero, a logarithm of a nonpositive number, etc.), then f(c) is not defined in practice, even if the interval symbol includes c. You should treat that the same as any other point where f(c) is not defined.\n\nSo you proceed this way:\n- First check whether the formula for the piece that supposedly defines f(c) actually yields a finite value at c. If it does, that is f(c).\n- If the formula is undefined at c, then f(c) is not defined (unless the problem explicitly states some defined value at c).\n- For continuity:\n  - If f(c) is defined, require the relevant one-sided limits equal f(c) (or both one-sided limits equal f(c) if c is an interior point).\n  - If f(c) is not defined, continuity at c would require the one-sided limits (the ones that make sense given the domain) to exist and be equal; then you could define f(c) to be that common limit to make the function continuous there. If the one-sided limits do not agree (or don't exist), the point is a discontinuity.\n\nExample to keep in mind: Suppose a piece is defined as (x^2 − 1)/(x − 1) for x ≤ 1. The algebraic expression is undefined at x = 1, even though the interval includes 1. You should note f(1) is not defined unless the definition separately specifies a value at 1. However, the one-sided limit (from the left) of that expression as x → 1− equals 2 (because the fraction simplifies to x+1 for x ≠ 1). So you could say the left-hand limit exists and equals 2, but f(1) is undefined — the function is not continuous at 1 unless you define f(1) = 2.\n\nWould you like to try a short example where the formula is undefined at the endpoint so you can apply these steps?\n- You: Thanks — that clarification really helped. One quick question: when a formula is undefined at c but the one-sided limits both exist and are equal (a removable discontinuity), is it correct that we say the original function is discontinuous at c but can be made continuous by defining f(c) equal to that common limit? And in practice, when solving for unknown constants to enforce continuity across a boundary, I can treat f(c) as “not defined” initially and instead set the left- and right-hand expressions equal to each other (ignoring f(c)) to get the equation. Is that the right procedure every time in removable-discontinuity cases?\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that's all correct. A few precise points to keep your understanding exact:\n\n- If the formula at c is undefined (so f(c) is not actually a value), then the function as written is discontinuous at c, even if both one-sided limits exist and are equal. That kind of discontinuity is called removable because you can \"remove\" it by defining f(c) to be the common limit.\n\n- In solving for unknown constants to enforce continuity at a boundary where the function currently has no defined value at c, the right procedure is exactly what you described: require the left-hand limit and right-hand limit to be equal. Concretely, pick the piece valid for x < c, evaluate its formula as x → c− (usually by direct substitution if it's a polynomial/rational expression that's defined at c), pick the piece valid for x > c and evaluate as x → c+, and set those two expressions equal. Solve for the unknown(s). After that, defining f(c) to be that common value yields a continuous function at c.\n\n- If f(c) is defined but the formula gives an indeterminate/undefined expression at c, treat f(c) as not defined (unless the problem explicitly gives a value) and follow the same approach above.\n\n- Small caution: when dealing with rational expressions that simplify to a continuous expression except at c, you can often simplify first (noting equivalence for x ≠ c) and then substitute the limit value; but remember that simplification doesn't retroactively define f(c). You still must check and (if required) specify f(c).\n\nWould you like to practice this with a short example where you solve for a constant that removes a discontinuity?\n- You: Thanks — that cleared up my confusion about inclusion vs. actual definability at c. One more quick thing: when the left- and right-hand expressions are algebraically different but both simplify to the same value at c (for example one side simplifies after canceling a factor that’s zero at c), is it always safe to directly substitute c into each simplified form when forming the equation for continuity? Or should I keep the original unsimplified expressions and only simplify after equating them? Which is the more reliable step to avoid mistakes when solving for unknown constants?\n- AI Tutor: Good question — being careful here avoids mistakes. Short answer: either approach can work, but you must keep track of where algebraic simplifications are valid. Here's a reliable procedure and the reason behind it:\n\n1. Identify which piece applies on each side of c (x < c and x > c). For each piece, consider the expression as defining the function for values not equal to c (i.e., in a neighborhood excluding c if necessary).\n\n2. For computing the one-sided limits, you may simplify each piece first (cancel factors, factor polynomials, etc.) as long as you remember that simplification is only valid for x values where the canceled factor is not zero. That is fine because one-sided limits look at x approaching c but not equaling c, so simplifications that are valid for x ≠ c are allowed when evaluating the limit.\n\n   - Example: if a piece is (x^2 − 1)/(x − 1) for x < 1, you can simplify to x + 1 for x ≠ 1 and then substitute x = 1 to get the left-hand limit 2.\n\n3. If you are forming algebraic equations to enforce continuity (i.e., setting left-hand limit = right-hand limit), it is safe and often simpler to simplify each expression first (valid for x ≠ c) and then substitute c to get the limit values to equate. This is the usual, reliable method when the simplifications do not depend on unknowns making denominators zero at c.\n\n4. Caution cases to watch for:\n   - If simplifying introduces division by an expression that might be zero for some values of the unknown constants, you must check those parameter values separately. For example, if simplification cancels a factor that contains the unknown constant, the cancellation might be invalid for certain constant values; always ensure the canceled factor is nonzero given the unknowns' values, or handle the special cases separately.\n   - If the original piece's formula truly fails to be defined at c (division by zero etc.), remember f(c) is still undefined unless explicitly given — simplification does not define f(c), it only gives the limit.\n\n5. Practical rule of thumb:\n   - Simplify each side (for x ≠ c), compute the one-sided limits by substituting c into the simplified forms, set those limits equal, and solve for unknowns.\n   - After solving, verify that your solution doesn't make any denominator (or other restricted expression) zero in the original formulas at values of x near c (which could invalidate the simplification step). If it does, handle that special case separately.\n\nWould you like to try a quick example where simplification cancels a factor so you can practice both the usual method and checking special cases?\n\n# Your Message Style\n## Interaction Style\n- Length of User Message: The user's query/response is always around 20 words.\n\n# Task\nGenerate your next message following these rules:\n1.

Which function values should I compare at x = 2 and x = -2?\n- AI Tutor: Good — you're on the right track by thinking about the boundary points where the formula changes. Continuity at a boundary means the left-hand and right-hand limits (which for piecewise-defined simple formulas are just the function values from the appropriate pieces) agree there and equal the value of the function at that point.\n\nIdentify the two boundary points: x = 2 and x = −2.\n\n1. At x = 2:\n- For x > 2 the expression used is ax + 3, so the right-hand value at 2 is a·2 + 3 = 2a + 3.\n- For −2 ≤ x ≤ 2 the expression used at x = 2 is x − 5, so the value there is 2 − 5 = −3.\nContinuity at x = 2 requires the right-hand value equal the value at 2. Write that equation.\n\n2. At x = −2:\n- For −2 ≤ x ≤ 2 the expression at x = −2 is x − 5, so the value there is −2 − 5 = −7.\n- For x < −2 the expression used is 2x − b, so the left-hand value at −2 is 2(−2) − b = −4 − b.\nContinuity at x = −2 requires the left-hand value equal the value at −2. Write that equation.\n\nNow you have two equations in a and b. What are those equations? Solve them for a and b, then compute a + b. If you want, tell me the equations you wrote and your steps to solve them and I’ll check your work.\n- You: Okay — the equations I get are 2a + 3 = −3 (from x = 2) and −4 − b = −7 (from x = −2). Can you confirm those are set up correctly? Also, could you show the algebra to solve each for a and b and then compute a + b?\n- AI Tutor: You're correct about the two equations — those come from setting the appropriate piecewise expressions equal at the boundary points. Now try solving each equation step by step; I'll guide you and check your work.\n\nStart with 2a + 3 = −3. Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the 2a term: what do you get next? \n\nThen move to −4 − b = −7. Add 4 to both sides to isolate −b: what does that give you, and what is b after you multiply or change sign?\n\nAfter you find a and b, add them to get a + b. Tell me the values you obtain and I'll confirm.\n- You: After solving, a = −3 and b = 3, so a + b = 0.\n- AI Tutor: Exactly right. Quick check of your steps:\n\n- From 2a + 3 = −3: subtract 3 to get 2a = −6, so a = −3.\n- From −4 − b = −7: add 4 to get −b = −3, so b = 3.\n- Then a + b = −3 + 3 = 0.\n\nEverything is correct. Nicely done.\n- You: Thanks — that explanation helped. One quick question: when deciding which piece to use for the left- or right-hand value at a boundary, is the rule always \"use the piece valid for x just less than the boundary for the left-hand limit, and the piece valid for x just greater than the boundary for the right-hand limit\"? Just want to be sure I apply that correctly on future piecewise problems.\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that rule is exactly right and is the general way to handle piecewise functions at boundary points.\n\nMore precisely:\n- The left-hand limit at a point x = c uses the formula that applies for x values slightly less than c (the piece covering values just to the left of c).\n- The right-hand limit at x = c uses the formula that applies for x values slightly greater than c (the piece covering values just to the right of c).\n- If the function is defined at c, its actual value f(c) may come from one of the pieces (depending on how the piecewise definition specifies the intervals). For continuity you need left-hand limit = right-hand limit = f(c).\n\nA couple of quick reminders:\n- Pay attention to whether the interval endpoints in the piecewise definition are included (≤ or ≥) or excluded (< or >). That tells you which piece gives f(c) itself.\n- Even if f(c) is defined by only one piece, both one-sided limits must still match that value for continuity.\n- If one-sided limits differ, the function has a jump discontinuity at c.\n\nIf you want, I can give a short example with different endpoint inclusions so you can practice identifying which piece to use for left, right, and f(c). Which would you prefer?\n- You: Thanks — that makes sense and I see how to pick the pieces for left and right limits now. Quick follow-up: if the piecewise definition uses strict inequalities on both sides (so f(c) isn't defined by either piece), we still just compare the left- and right-hand expressions — do we then say the function is discontinuous at c unless those two one-sided limits happen to be equal? Is that the right way to state it?\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that's exactly right. If f(c) is not defined (because neither piece includes x = c), then for continuity at c you'd need both one-sided limits to exist and be equal; only then could you extend f to be continuous there by defining f(c) equal to that common value. If the left- and right-hand limits are different (or one/both fail to exist), the function has a discontinuity at c and you cannot make it continuous at c without changing the function.\n\nMore compactly:\n- If f(c) is defined: continuity at c requires left-hand limit = right-hand limit = f(c).\n- If f(c) is not defined: continuity at c would require left-hand limit = right-hand limit (and then you could define f(c) to be that common value to make it continuous). If the one-sided limits differ, the point is a jump discontinuity.\n\nGood thinking — do you want an example where f(c) isn't defined so you can practice deciding whether the limits match?\n- You: Thanks — that cleared it up. One quick thing I'd like to confirm: when checking continuity at a boundary I should first note which inequalities include the endpoint (≤ or ≥) to identify f(c) if it’s defined, then independently pick the piece for x<c for the left-hand limit and the piece for x>c for the right-hand limit, and finally compare left, right, and f(c) (if present). Is that the complete checklist I should use every time?\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that checklist is complete and a reliable procedure to follow every time. In summary, when checking continuity at a boundary point c:\n\n1. Check whether f(c) is defined by looking at the interval endpoints (≤ / ≥ vs < / >). If included, determine f(c) from the piece that contains c.\n2. For the left-hand limit, use the formula that applies for x values just less than c (the piece covering x < c near c).\n3. For the right-hand limit, use the formula that applies for x values just greater than c (the piece covering x > c near c).\n4. Compare:\n   - If f(c) is defined: require left-hand limit = right-hand limit = f(c).\n   - If f(c) is not defined: require left-hand limit = right-hand limit in order for the function to be extendable to a continuous function at c; otherwise it's discontinuous.\n\nExtra tips:\n- Watch endpoint inclusions carefully — they determine which piece gives f(c).\n- You can compute the one-sided limits by directly substituting c into the corresponding formulas when those formulas are polynomials/linear (or otherwise continuous on their intervals).\n- If either one-sided limit does not exist, the function is discontinuous at c.\n\nWould you like a quick example to practice this checklist?\n- You: Thanks — that checklist makes sense and I see how to apply it. One question: if the boundary point is also the domain endpoint (so only one side of x exists in the domain), do I treat the absent side as \"not applicable\" or do I still require the existing one-sided limit to equal f(c) for continuity at that endpoint?\n- AI Tutor: Good question — endpoints of the domain are a special but simple case.\n\nIf c is an endpoint of the domain (so values only exist on one side of c), you treat the missing one-sided limit as not applicable. Continuity at c then requires that the one existing one-sided limit equals f(c).\n\nMore concretely:\n- If the domain includes values only for x ≥ c (left endpoint), check the right-hand limit lim_{x→c+} f(x).

Caution cases to watch for:\n   - If simplifying introduces division by an expression that might be zero for some values of the unknown constants, you must check those parameter values separately. For example, if simplification cancels a factor that contains the unknown constant, the cancellation might be invalid for certain constant values; always ensure the canceled factor is nonzero given the unknowns' values, or handle the special cases separately.\n   - If the original piece's formula truly fails to be defined at c (division by zero etc.), remember f(c) is still undefined unless explicitly given — simplification does not define f(c), it only gives the limit.\n\n5. Practical rule of thumb:\n   - Simplify each side (for x ≠ c), compute the one-sided limits by substituting c into the simplified forms, set those limits equal, and solve for unknowns.\n   - After solving, verify that your solution doesn't make any denominator (or other restricted expression) zero in the original formulas at values of x near c (which could invalidate the simplification step). If it does, handle that special case separately.\n\nWould you like to try a quick example where simplification cancels a factor so you can practice both the usual method and checking special cases?\n\n# Your Message Style\n## Interaction Style\n- Length of User Message: The user's query/response is always around 20 words.\n\n# Task\nGenerate your next message following these rules:\n1.

One quick question: when deciding which piece to use for the left- or right-hand value at a boundary, is the rule always \"use the piece valid for x just less than the boundary for the left-hand limit, and the piece valid for x just greater than the boundary for the right-hand limit\"? Just want to be sure I apply that correctly on future piecewise problems."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes — that rule is exactly right and is the general way to handle piecewise functions at boundary points.\n\nMore precisely:\n- The left-hand limit at a point x = c uses the formula that applies for x values slightly less than c (the piece covering values just to the left of c).\n- The right-hand limit at x = c uses the formula that applies for x values slightly greater than c (the piece covering values just to the right of c).\n- If the function is defined at c, its actual value f(c) may come from one of the pieces (depending on how the piecewise definition specifies the intervals). For continuity you need left-hand limit = right-hand limit = f(c).\n\nA couple of quick reminders:\n- Pay attention to whether the interval endpoints in the piecewise definition are included (≤ or ≥) or excluded (< or >). That tells you which piece gives f(c) itself.\n- Even if f(c) is defined by only one piece, both one-sided limits must still match that value for continuity.\n- If one-sided limits differ, the function has a jump discontinuity at c.\n\nIf you want, I can give a short example with different endpoint inclusions so you can practice identifying which piece to use for left, right, and f(c). Which would you prefer?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thanks — that makes sense and I see how to pick the pieces for left and right limits now. Quick follow-up: if the piecewise definition uses strict inequalities on both sides (so f(c) isn't defined by either piece), we still just compare the left- and right-hand expressions — do we then say the function is discontinuous at c unless those two one-sided limits happen to be equal? Is that the right way to state it?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes — that's exactly right. If f(c) is not defined (because neither piece includes x = c), then for continuity at c you'd need both one-sided limits to exist and be equal; only then could you extend f to be continuous there by defining f(c) equal to that common value. If the left- and right-hand limits are different (or one/both fail to exist), the function has a discontinuity at c and you cannot make it continuous at c without changing the function.\n\nMore compactly:\n- If f(c) is defined: continuity at c requires left-hand limit = right-hand limit = f(c).\n- If f(c) is not defined: continuity at c would require left-hand limit = right-hand limit (and then you could define f(c) to be that common value to make it continuous).

One quick thing I'd like to confirm: when checking continuity at a boundary I should first note which inequalities include the endpoint (≤ or ≥) to identify f(c) if it’s defined, then independently pick the piece for x<c for the left-hand limit and the piece for x>c for the right-hand limit, and finally compare left, right, and f(c) (if present). Is that the complete checklist I should use every time?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes — that checklist is complete and a reliable procedure to follow every time. In summary, when checking continuity at a boundary point c:\n\n1. Check whether f(c) is defined by looking at the interval endpoints (≤ / ≥ vs < / >). If included, determine f(c) from the piece that contains c.\n2. For the left-hand limit, use the formula that applies for x values just less than c (the piece covering x < c near c).\n3. For the right-hand limit, use the formula that applies for x values just greater than c (the piece covering x > c near c).\n4. Compare:\n   - If f(c) is defined: require left-hand limit = right-hand limit = f(c).\n   - If f(c) is not defined: require left-hand limit = right-hand limit in order for the function to be extendable to a continuous function at c; otherwise it's discontinuous.\n\nExtra tips:\n- Watch endpoint inclusions carefully — they determine which piece gives f(c).\n- You can compute the one-sided limits by directly substituting c into the corresponding formulas when those formulas are polynomials/linear (or otherwise continuous on their intervals).\n- If either one-sided limit does not exist, the function is discontinuous at c.\n\nWould you like a quick example to practice this checklist?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thanks — that checklist makes sense and I see how to apply it. One question: if the boundary point is also the domain endpoint (so only one side of x exists in the domain), do I treat the absent side as \"not applicable\" or do I still require the existing one-sided limit to equal f(c) for continuity at that endpoint?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Good question — endpoints of the domain are a special but simple case.\n\nIf c is an endpoint of the domain (so values only exist on one side of c), you treat the missing one-sided limit as not applicable. Continuity at c then requires that the one existing one-sided limit equals f(c).\n\nMore concretely:\n- If the domain includes values only for x ≥ c (left endpoint), check the right-hand limit lim_{x→c+} f(x). If f(c) is defined, continuity at c means lim_{x→c+} f(x) = f(c). (The left-hand limit lim_{x→c-} is not applicable.)\n- If the domain includes values only for x ≤ c (right endpoint), check the left-hand limit lim_{x→c-} f(x). Continuity at c means lim_{x→c-} f(x) = f(c). (The right-hand limit is not applicable.)\n\nIn short: at a domain endpoint you only require the one relevant one-sided limit to match f(c). If f(c) is not defined, you cannot have continuity at that endpoint (unless you extend the function by defining f(c) equal to the existing one-sided limit). \n\nWould you like a quick example of checking continuity at a domain endpoint?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thanks — that clarification helped. I see that at a domain endpoint I only need the existing one-sided limit to match f(c). One quick follow-up: if the endpoint is included in a piecewise definition but the formula there is something like a fraction that becomes undefined at c (so f(c) isn't actually defined even though the inequality includes c), do we treat that the same as \"f(c) not defined\" and therefore say it's discontinuous unless the one-sided limit exists and we redefine f(c)? In other words, inclusion by the interval doesn't override the function being undefined at that point — right?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Right — inclusion by the interval does not override the actual formula failing to produce a value at that point. If the piece that \"contains\" c has a formula that is undefined at c (like a division by zero, a logarithm of a nonpositive number, etc.), then f(c) is not defined in practice, even if the interval symbol includes c. You should treat that the same as any other point where f(c) is not defined.\n\nSo you proceed this way:\n- First check whether the formula for the piece that supposedly defines f(c) actually yields a finite value at c. If it does, that is f(c).\n- If the formula is undefined at c, then f(c) is not defined (unless the problem explicitly states some defined value at c).\n- For continuity:\n  - If f(c) is defined, require the relevant one-sided limits equal f(c) (or both one-sided limits equal f(c) if c is an interior point).\n  - If f(c) is not defined, continuity at c would require the one-sided limits (the ones that make sense given the domain) to exist and be equal; then you could define f(c) to be that common limit to make the function continuous there. If the one-sided limits do not agree (or don't exist), the point is a discontinuity.\n\nExample to keep in mind: Suppose a piece is defined as (x^2 − 1)/(x − 1) for x ≤ 1. The algebraic expression is undefined at x = 1, even though the interval includes 1. You should note f(1) is not defined unless the definition separately specifies a value at 1. However, the one-sided limit (from the left) of that expression as x → 1− equals 2 (because the fraction simplifies to x+1 for x ≠ 1). So you could say the left-hand limit exists and equals 2, but f(1) is undefined — the function is not continuous at 1 unless you define f(1) = 2.\n\nWould you like to try a short example where the formula is undefined at the endpoint so you can apply these steps?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thanks — that clarification really helped. One quick question: when a formula is undefined at c but the one-sided limits both exist and are equal (a removable discontinuity), is it correct that we say the original function is discontinuous at c but can be made continuous by defining f(c) equal to that common limit? And in practice, when solving for unknown constants to enforce continuity across a boundary, I can treat f(c) as “not defined” initially and instead set the left- and right-hand expressions equal to each other (ignoring f(c)) to get the equation. Is that the right procedure every time in removable-discontinuity cases?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes — that's all correct. A few precise points to keep your understanding exact:\n\n- If the formula at c is undefined (so f(c) is not actually a value), then the function as written is discontinuous at c, even if both one-sided limits exist and are equal. That kind of discontinuity is called removable because you can \"remove\" it by defining f(c) to be the common limit.\n\n- In solving for unknown constants to enforce continuity at a boundary where the function currently has no defined value at c, the right procedure is exactly what you described: require the left-hand limit and right-hand limit to be equal. Concretely, pick the piece valid for x < c, evaluate its formula as x → c− (usually by direct substitution if it's a polynomial/rational expression that's defined at c), pick the piece valid for x > c and evaluate as x → c+, and set those two expressions equal. Solve for the unknown(s). After that, defining f(c) to be that common value yields a continuous function at c.\n\n- If f(c) is defined but the formula gives an indeterminate/undefined expression at c, treat f(c) as not defined (unless the problem explicitly gives a value) and follow the same approach above.\n\n- Small caution: when dealing with rational expressions that simplify to a continuous expression except at c, you can often simplify first (noting equivalence for x ≠ c) and then substitute the limit value; but remember that simplification doesn't retroactively define f(c). You still must check and (if required) specify f(c).\n\nWould you like to practice this with a short example where you solve for a constant that removes a discontinuity?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thanks — that cleared up my confusion about inclusion vs. actual definability at c. One more quick thing: when the left- and right-hand expressions are algebraically different but both simplify to the same value at c (for example one side simplifies after canceling a factor that’s zero at c), is it always safe to directly substitute c into each simplified form when forming the equation for continuity? Or should I keep the original unsimplified expressions and only simplify after equating them? Which is the more reliable step to avoid mistakes when solving for unknown constants?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Good question — being careful here avoids mistakes. Short answer: either approach can work, but you must keep track of where algebraic simplifications are valid. Here's a reliable procedure and the reason behind it:\n\n1. Identify which piece applies on each side of c (x < c and x > c). For each piece, consider the expression as defining the function for values not equal to c (i.e., in a neighborhood excluding c if necessary).\n\n2. For computing the one-sided limits, you may simplify each piece first (cancel factors, factor polynomials, etc.) as long as you remember that simplification is only valid for x values where the canceled factor is not zero. That is fine because one-sided limits look at x approaching c but not equaling c, so simplifications that are valid for x ≠ c are allowed when evaluating the limit.\n\n   - Example: if a piece is (x^2 − 1)/(x − 1) for x < 1, you can simplify to x + 1 for x ≠ 1 and then substitute x = 1 to get the left-hand limit 2.\n\n3. If you are forming algebraic equations to enforce continuity (i.e., setting left-hand limit = right-hand limit), it is safe and often simpler to simplify each expression first (valid for x ≠ c) and then substitute c to get the limit values to equate.

Check whether f(c) is actually defined in the piecewise definition:\n   - If the interval inclusion gives f(c) (≤ or ≥) and the substituted formula is defined at c, compute f(c) and verify it equals the common one-sided limit.\n   - If the piece's formula is undefined at c (even if the interval includes c), then f(c) is not defined; in that case the original function is still discontinuous at c until you explicitly define f(c) equal to the common limit. Note this does not contradict solving for parameters to make the limits equal — it only means you must define f(c) afterward to make the function continuous as written.\n5. If any parameter value you found makes a denominator zero (or otherwise causes the expression to be undefined) at x values arbitrarily close to c for the relevant side, you must treat that as a special case. Either:\n   - reject that parameter value if it prevents the required limit from existing, or\n   - analyze it separately to see whether the limit still exists (often it won't).\n\nIn short: yes — substitute parameter values back into the original formulas and check for undefined behavior near the boundary; additionally, explicitly check f(c) (if the interval includes c) to ensure it matches the one-sided limits.

Those steps together constitute the complete post-solution check.\n\n# Conversation History\n- You: How do I use continuity at the boundary points to create equations for a and b? Which function values should I compare at x = 2 and x = -2?\n- AI Tutor: Good — you're on the right track by thinking about the boundary points where the formula changes. Continuity at a boundary means the left-hand and right-hand limits (which for piecewise-defined simple formulas are just the function values from the appropriate pieces) agree there and equal the value of the function at that point.\n\nIdentify the two boundary points: x = 2 and x = −2.\n\n1. At x = 2:\n- For x > 2 the expression used is ax + 3, so the right-hand value at 2 is a·2 + 3 = 2a + 3.\n- For −2 ≤ x ≤ 2 the expression used at x = 2 is x − 5, so the value there is 2 − 5 = −3.\nContinuity at x = 2 requires the right-hand value equal the value at 2. Write that equation.\n\n2. At x = −2:\n- For −2 ≤ x ≤ 2 the expression at x = −2 is x − 5, so the value there is −2 − 5 = −7.\n- For x < −2 the expression used is 2x − b, so the left-hand value at −2 is 2(−2) − b = −4 − b.\nContinuity at x = −2 requires the left-hand value equal the value at −2. Write that equation.\n\nNow you have two equations in a and b. What are those equations? Solve them for a and b, then compute a + b. If you want, tell me the equations you wrote and your steps to solve them and I’ll check your work.\n- You: Okay — the equations I get are 2a + 3 = −3 (from x = 2) and −4 − b = −7 (from x = −2). Can you confirm those are set up correctly? Also, could you show the algebra to solve each for a and b and then compute a + b?\n- AI Tutor: You're correct about the two equations — those come from setting the appropriate piecewise expressions equal at the boundary points. Now try solving each equation step by step; I'll guide you and check your work.\n\nStart with 2a + 3 = −3. Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the 2a term: what do you get next? \n\nThen move to −4 − b = −7. Add 4 to both sides to isolate −b: what does that give you, and what is b after you multiply or change sign?\n\nAfter you find a and b, add them to get a + b. Tell me the values you obtain and I'll confirm.\n- You: After solving, a = −3 and b = 3, so a + b = 0.\n- AI Tutor: Exactly right. Quick check of your steps:\n\n- From 2a + 3 = −3: subtract 3 to get 2a = −6, so a = −3.\n- From −4 − b = −7: add 4 to get −b = −3, so b = 3.\n- Then a + b = −3 + 3 = 0.\n\nEverything is correct. Nicely done.\n- You: Thanks — that explanation helped. One quick question: when deciding which piece to use for the left- or right-hand value at a boundary, is the rule always \"use the piece valid for x just less than the boundary for the left-hand limit, and the piece valid for x just greater than the boundary for the right-hand limit\"? Just want to be sure I apply that correctly on future piecewise problems.\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that rule is exactly right and is the general way to handle piecewise functions at boundary points.\n\nMore precisely:\n- The left-hand limit at a point x = c uses the formula that applies for x values slightly less than c (the piece covering values just to the left of c).\n- The right-hand limit at x = c uses the formula that applies for x values slightly greater than c (the piece covering values just to the right of c).\n- If the function is defined at c, its actual value f(c) may come from one of the pieces (depending on how the piecewise definition specifies the intervals). For continuity you need left-hand limit = right-hand limit = f(c).\n\nA couple of quick reminders:\n- Pay attention to whether the interval endpoints in the piecewise definition are included (≤ or ≥) or excluded (< or >). That tells you which piece gives f(c) itself.\n- Even if f(c) is defined by only one piece, both one-sided limits must still match that value for continuity.\n- If one-sided limits differ, the function has a jump discontinuity at c.\n\nIf you want, I can give a short example with different endpoint inclusions so you can practice identifying which piece to use for left, right, and f(c). Which would you prefer?\n- You: Thanks — that makes sense and I see how to pick the pieces for left and right limits now. Quick follow-up: if the piecewise definition uses strict inequalities on both sides (so f(c) isn't defined by either piece), we still just compare the left- and right-hand expressions — do we then say the function is discontinuous at c unless those two one-sided limits happen to be equal? Is that the right way to state it?\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that's exactly right. If f(c) is not defined (because neither piece includes x = c), then for continuity at c you'd need both one-sided limits to exist and be equal; only then could you extend f to be continuous there by defining f(c) equal to that common value. If the left- and right-hand limits are different (or one/both fail to exist), the function has a discontinuity at c and you cannot make it continuous at c without changing the function.\n\nMore compactly:\n- If f(c) is defined: continuity at c requires left-hand limit = right-hand limit = f(c).\n- If f(c) is not defined: continuity at c would require left-hand limit = right-hand limit (and then you could define f(c) to be that common value to make it continuous). If the one-sided limits differ, the point is a jump discontinuity.\n\nGood thinking — do you want an example where f(c) isn't defined so you can practice deciding whether the limits match?\n- You: Thanks — that cleared it up. One quick thing I'd like to confirm: when checking continuity at a boundary I should first note which inequalities include the endpoint (≤ or ≥) to identify f(c) if it’s defined, then independently pick the piece for x<c for the left-hand limit and the piece for x>c for the right-hand limit, and finally compare left, right, and f(c) (if present). Is that the complete checklist I should use every time?\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that checklist is complete and a reliable procedure to follow every time. In summary, when checking continuity at a boundary point c:\n\n1. Check whether f(c) is defined by looking at the interval endpoints (≤ / ≥ vs < / >). If included, determine f(c) from the piece that contains c.\n2. For the left-hand limit, use the formula that applies for x values just less than c (the piece covering x < c near c).\n3. For the right-hand limit, use the formula that applies for x values just greater than c (the piece covering x > c near c).\n4. Compare:\n   - If f(c) is defined: require left-hand limit = right-hand limit = f(c).\n   - If f(c) is not defined: require left-hand limit = right-hand limit in order for the function to be extendable to a continuous function at c; otherwise it's discontinuous.\n\nExtra tips:\n- Watch endpoint inclusions carefully — they determine which piece gives f(c).\n- You can compute the one-sided limits by directly substituting c into the corresponding formulas when those formulas are polynomials/linear (or otherwise continuous on their intervals).\n- If either one-sided limit does not exist, the function is discontinuous at c.\n\nWould you like a quick example to practice this checklist?\n- You: Thanks — that checklist makes sense and I see how to apply it. One question: if the boundary point is also the domain endpoint (so only one side of x exists in the domain), do I treat the absent side as \"not applicable\" or do I still require the existing one-sided limit to equal f(c) for continuity at that endpoint?\n- AI Tutor: Good question — endpoints of the domain are a special but simple case.\n\nIf c is an endpoint of the domain (so values only exist on one side of c), you treat the missing one-sided limit as not applicable. Continuity at c then requires that the one existing one-sided limit equals f(c).\n\nMore concretely:\n- If the domain includes values only for x ≥ c (left endpoint), check the right-hand limit lim_{x→c+} f(x). If f(c) is defined, continuity at c means lim_{x→c+} f(x) = f(c). (The left-hand limit lim_{x→c-} is not applicable.)\n- If the domain includes values only for x ≤ c (right endpoint), check the left-hand limit lim_{x→c-} f(x). Continuity at c means lim_{x→c-} f(x) = f(c). (The right-hand limit is not applicable.)\n\nIn short: at a domain endpoint you only require the one relevant one-sided limit to match f(c). If f(c) is not defined, you cannot have continuity at that endpoint (unless you extend the function by defining f(c) equal to the existing one-sided limit). \n\nWould you like a quick example of checking continuity at a domain endpoint?\n- You: Thanks — that clarification helped. I see that at a domain endpoint I only need the existing one-sided limit to match f(c). One quick follow-up: if the endpoint is included in a piecewise definition but the formula there is something like a fraction that becomes undefined at c (so f(c) isn't actually defined even though the inequality includes c), do we treat that the same as \"f(c) not defined\" and therefore say it's discontinuous unless the one-sided limit exists and we redefine f(c)? In other words, inclusion by the interval doesn't override the function being undefined at that point — right?\n- AI Tutor: Right — inclusion by the interval does not override the actual formula failing to produce a value at that point. If the piece that \"contains\" c has a formula that is undefined at c (like a division by zero, a logarithm of a nonpositive number, etc.), then f(c) is not defined in practice, even if the interval symbol includes c. You should treat that the same as any other point where f(c) is not defined.\n\nSo you proceed this way:\n- First check whether the formula for the piece that supposedly defines f(c) actually yields a finite value at c. If it does, that is f(c).\n- If the formula is undefined at c, then f(c) is not defined (unless the problem explicitly states some defined value at c).\n- For continuity:\n  - If f(c) is defined, require the relevant one-sided limits equal f(c) (or both one-sided limits equal f(c) if c is an interior point).\n  - If f(c) is not defined, continuity at c would require the one-sided limits (the ones that make sense given the domain) to exist and be equal; then you could define f(c) to be that common limit to make the function continuous there. If the one-sided limits do not agree (or don't exist), the point is a discontinuity.\n\nExample to keep in mind: Suppose a piece is defined as (x^2 − 1)/(x − 1) for x ≤ 1. The algebraic expression is undefined at x = 1, even though the interval includes 1. You should note f(1) is not defined unless the definition separately specifies a value at 1. However, the one-sided limit (from the left) of that expression as x → 1− equals 2 (because the fraction simplifies to x+1 for x ≠ 1). So you could say the left-hand limit exists and equals 2, but f(1) is undefined — the function is not continuous at 1 unless you define f(1) = 2.\n\nWould you like to try a short example where the formula is undefined at the endpoint so you can apply these steps?\n- You: Thanks — that clarification really helped. One quick question: when a formula is undefined at c but the one-sided limits both exist and are equal (a removable discontinuity), is it correct that we say the original function is discontinuous at c but can be made continuous by defining f(c) equal to that common limit? And in practice, when solving for unknown constants to enforce continuity across a boundary, I can treat f(c) as “not defined” initially and instead set the left- and right-hand expressions equal to each other (ignoring f(c)) to get the equation. Is that the right procedure every time in removable-discontinuity cases?\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that's all correct. A few precise points to keep your understanding exact:\n\n- If the formula at c is undefined (so f(c) is not actually a value), then the function as written is discontinuous at c, even if both one-sided limits exist and are equal. That kind of discontinuity is called removable because you can \"remove\" it by defining f(c) to be the common limit.\n\n- In solving for unknown constants to enforce continuity at a boundary where the function currently has no defined value at c, the right procedure is exactly what you described: require the left-hand limit and right-hand limit to be equal. Concretely, pick the piece valid for x < c, evaluate its formula as x → c− (usually by direct substitution if it's a polynomial/rational expression that's defined at c), pick the piece valid for x > c and evaluate as x → c+, and set those two expressions equal. Solve for the unknown(s). After that, defining f(c) to be that common value yields a continuous function at c.\n\n- If f(c) is defined but the formula gives an indeterminate/undefined expression at c, treat f(c) as not defined (unless the problem explicitly gives a value) and follow the same approach above.\n\n- Small caution: when dealing with rational expressions that simplify to a continuous expression except at c, you can often simplify first (noting equivalence for x ≠ c) and then substitute the limit value; but remember that simplification doesn't retroactively define f(c). You still must check and (if required) specify f(c).\n\nWould you like to practice this with a short example where you solve for a constant that removes a discontinuity?\n- You: Thanks — that cleared up my confusion about inclusion vs. actual definability at c. One more quick thing: when the left- and right-hand expressions are algebraically different but both simplify to the same value at c (for example one side simplifies after canceling a factor that’s zero at c), is it always safe to directly substitute c into each simplified form when forming the equation for continuity? Or should I keep the original unsimplified expressions and only simplify after equating them? Which is the more reliable step to avoid mistakes when solving for unknown constants?\n- AI Tutor: Good question — being careful here avoids mistakes. Short answer: either approach can work, but you must keep track of where algebraic simplifications are valid. Here's a reliable procedure and the reason behind it:\n\n1. Identify which piece applies on each side of c (x < c and x > c). For each piece, consider the expression as defining the function for values not equal to c (i.e., in a neighborhood excluding c if necessary).\n\n2. For computing the one-sided limits, you may simplify each piece first (cancel factors, factor polynomials, etc.) as long as you remember that simplification is only valid for x values where the canceled factor is not zero. That is fine because one-sided limits look at x approaching c but not equaling c, so simplifications that are valid for x ≠ c are allowed when evaluating the limit.\n\n   - Example: if a piece is (x^2 − 1)/(x − 1) for x < 1, you can simplify to x + 1 for x ≠ 1 and then substitute x = 1 to get the left-hand limit 2.\n\n3. If you are forming algebraic equations to enforce continuity (i.e., setting left-hand limit = right-hand limit), it is safe and often simpler to simplify each expression first (valid for x ≠ c) and then substitute c to get the limit values to equate. This is the usual, reliable method when the simplifications do not depend on unknowns making denominators zero at c.\n\n4. Caution cases to watch for:\n   - If simplifying introduces division by an expression that might be zero for some values of the unknown constants, you must check those parameter values separately. For example, if simplification cancels a factor that contains the unknown constant, the cancellation might be invalid for certain constant values; always ensure the canceled factor is nonzero given the unknowns' values, or handle the special cases separately.\n   - If the original piece's formula truly fails to be defined at c (division by zero etc.), remember f(c) is still undefined unless explicitly given — simplification does not define f(c), it only gives the limit.\n\n5. Practical rule of thumb:\n   - Simplify each side (for x ≠ c), compute the one-sided limits by substituting c into the simplified forms, set those limits equal, and solve for unknowns.\n   - After solving, verify that your solution doesn't make any denominator (or other restricted expression) zero in the original formulas at values of x near c (which could invalidate the simplification step). If it does, handle that special case separately.\n\nWould you like to try a quick example where simplification cancels a factor so you can practice both the usual method and checking special cases?\n- You: Thanks — that explanation helped me learn the nuance about cancellations depending on unknown constants. One quick confirmation: after I solve the equations produced by equating the one-sided limits (using simplified forms), the final extra check should be to substitute the found parameter values back into the original piecewise formulas and verify no denominator (or other undefined expression) is zero for x near the boundary — is that the complete post-solution check, or should I also explicitly test the original unsimplified expressions at the boundary point itself?\n- AI Tutor: Good attention to detail — that's exactly the right idea, and you're mostly done with the checks. Here's a concise checklist of what to do after you solve for the parameters; follow these to be thorough and avoid subtle mistakes:\n\n1. Substitute the found parameter values into the original piecewise formulas.\n2. Check the one-sided limits near the boundary by substituting the boundary value into the simplified forms (these give the limits because simplification is valid for x ≠ c). Confirm they are equal (this should hold because you solved for that).\n3. Check the original (unsimplified) formulas for any expressions that are undefined at or near c:\n   - Verify no denominator becomes zero for x values arbitrarily close to c on the side where that piece is used.\n   - Verify there are no other domain issues (like logs of nonpositive numbers, square roots of negatives, etc.) for x near c.\n4. Check whether f(c) is actually defined in the piecewise definition:\n   - If the interval inclusion gives f(c) (≤ or ≥) and the substituted formula is defined at c, compute f(c) and verify it equals the common one-sided limit.\n   - If the piece's formula is undefined at c (even if the interval includes c), then f(c) is not defined; in that case the original function is still discontinuous at c until you explicitly define f(c) equal to the common limit. Note this does not contradict solving for parameters to make the limits equal — it only means you must define f(c) afterward to make the function continuous as written.\n5. If any parameter value you found makes a denominator zero (or otherwise causes the expression to be undefined) at x values arbitrarily close to c for the relevant side, you must treat that as a special case. Either:\n   - reject that parameter value if it prevents the required limit from existing, or\n   - analyze it separately to see whether the limit still exists (often it won't).\n\nIn short: yes — substitute parameter values back into the original formulas and check for undefined behavior near the boundary; additionally, explicitly check f(c) (if the interval includes c) to ensure it matches the one-sided limits. Those steps together constitute the complete post-solution check.\n\n# Your Message Style\n## Interaction Style\n- Length of User Message: The user's query/response is always around 20 words.\n\n# Task\nGenerate your next message following these rules:\n1.

Those steps together constitute the complete post-solution check.\n\n# Conversation History\n- You: How do I use continuity at the boundary points to create equations for a and b? Which function values should I compare at x = 2 and x = -2?\n- AI Tutor: Good — you're on the right track by thinking about the boundary points where the formula changes. Continuity at a boundary means the left-hand and right-hand limits (which for piecewise-defined simple formulas are just the function values from the appropriate pieces) agree there and equal the value of the function at that point.\n\nIdentify the two boundary points: x = 2 and x = −2.\n\n1. At x = 2:\n- For x > 2 the expression used is ax + 3, so the right-hand value at 2 is a·2 + 3 = 2a + 3.\n- For −2 ≤ x ≤ 2 the expression used at x = 2 is x − 5, so the value there is 2 − 5 = −3.\nContinuity at x = 2 requires the right-hand value equal the value at 2. Write that equation.\n\n2. At x = −2:\n- For −2 ≤ x ≤ 2 the expression at x = −2 is x − 5, so the value there is −2 − 5 = −7.\n- For x < −2 the expression used is 2x − b, so the left-hand value at −2 is 2(−2) − b = −4 − b.\nContinuity at x = −2 requires the left-hand value equal the value at −2. Write that equation.\n\nNow you have two equations in a and b. What are those equations? Solve them for a and b, then compute a + b. If you want, tell me the equations you wrote and your steps to solve them and I’ll check your work.\n- You: Okay — the equations I get are 2a + 3 = −3 (from x = 2) and −4 − b = −7 (from x = −2). Can you confirm those are set up correctly? Also, could you show the algebra to solve each for a and b and then compute a + b?\n- AI Tutor: You're correct about the two equations — those come from setting the appropriate piecewise expressions equal at the boundary points. Now try solving each equation step by step; I'll guide you and check your work.\n\nStart with 2a + 3 = −3. Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the 2a term: what do you get next? \n\nThen move to −4 − b = −7. Add 4 to both sides to isolate −b: what does that give you, and what is b after you multiply or change sign?\n\nAfter you find a and b, add them to get a + b. Tell me the values you obtain and I'll confirm.\n- You: After solving, a = −3 and b = 3, so a + b = 0.\n- AI Tutor: Exactly right. Quick check of your steps:\n\n- From 2a + 3 = −3: subtract 3 to get 2a = −6, so a = −3.\n- From −4 − b = −7: add 4 to get −b = −3, so b = 3.\n- Then a + b = −3 + 3 = 0.\n\nEverything is correct. Nicely done.\n- You: Thanks — that explanation helped. One quick question: when deciding which piece to use for the left- or right-hand value at a boundary, is the rule always \"use the piece valid for x just less than the boundary for the left-hand limit, and the piece valid for x just greater than the boundary for the right-hand limit\"? Just want to be sure I apply that correctly on future piecewise problems.\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that rule is exactly right and is the general way to handle piecewise functions at boundary points.\n\nMore precisely:\n- The left-hand limit at a point x = c uses the formula that applies for x values slightly less than c (the piece covering values just to the left of c).\n- The right-hand limit at x = c uses the formula that applies for x values slightly greater than c (the piece covering values just to the right of c).\n- If the function is defined at c, its actual value f(c) may come from one of the pieces (depending on how the piecewise definition specifies the intervals). For continuity you need left-hand limit = right-hand limit = f(c).\n\nA couple of quick reminders:\n- Pay attention to whether the interval endpoints in the piecewise definition are included (≤ or ≥) or excluded (< or >). That tells you which piece gives f(c) itself.\n- Even if f(c) is defined by only one piece, both one-sided limits must still match that value for continuity.\n- If one-sided limits differ, the function has a jump discontinuity at c.\n\nIf you want, I can give a short example with different endpoint inclusions so you can practice identifying which piece to use for left, right, and f(c). Which would you prefer?\n- You: Thanks — that makes sense and I see how to pick the pieces for left and right limits now. Quick follow-up: if the piecewise definition uses strict inequalities on both sides (so f(c) isn't defined by either piece), we still just compare the left- and right-hand expressions — do we then say the function is discontinuous at c unless those two one-sided limits happen to be equal? Is that the right way to state it?\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that's exactly right. If f(c) is not defined (because neither piece includes x = c), then for continuity at c you'd need both one-sided limits to exist and be equal; only then could you extend f to be continuous there by defining f(c) equal to that common value. If the left- and right-hand limits are different (or one/both fail to exist), the function has a discontinuity at c and you cannot make it continuous at c without changing the function.\n\nMore compactly:\n- If f(c) is defined: continuity at c requires left-hand limit = right-hand limit = f(c).\n- If f(c) is not defined: continuity at c would require left-hand limit = right-hand limit (and then you could define f(c) to be that common value to make it continuous). If the one-sided limits differ, the point is a jump discontinuity.\n\nGood thinking — do you want an example where f(c) isn't defined so you can practice deciding whether the limits match?\n- You: Thanks — that cleared it up. One quick thing I'd like to confirm: when checking continuity at a boundary I should first note which inequalities include the endpoint (≤ or ≥) to identify f(c) if it’s defined, then independently pick the piece for x<c for the left-hand limit and the piece for x>c for the right-hand limit, and finally compare left, right, and f(c) (if present). Is that the complete checklist I should use every time?\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that checklist is complete and a reliable procedure to follow every time. In summary, when checking continuity at a boundary point c:\n\n1. Check whether f(c) is defined by looking at the interval endpoints (≤ / ≥ vs < / >). If included, determine f(c) from the piece that contains c.\n2. For the left-hand limit, use the formula that applies for x values just less than c (the piece covering x < c near c).\n3. For the right-hand limit, use the formula that applies for x values just greater than c (the piece covering x > c near c).\n4. Compare:\n   - If f(c) is defined: require left-hand limit = right-hand limit = f(c).\n   - If f(c) is not defined: require left-hand limit = right-hand limit in order for the function to be extendable to a continuous function at c; otherwise it's discontinuous.\n\nExtra tips:\n- Watch endpoint inclusions carefully — they determine which piece gives f(c).\n- You can compute the one-sided limits by directly substituting c into the corresponding formulas when those formulas are polynomials/linear (or otherwise continuous on their intervals).\n- If either one-sided limit does not exist, the function is discontinuous at c.\n\nWould you like a quick example to practice this checklist?\n- You: Thanks — that checklist makes sense and I see how to apply it. One question: if the boundary point is also the domain endpoint (so only one side of x exists in the domain), do I treat the absent side as \"not applicable\" or do I still require the existing one-sided limit to equal f(c) for continuity at that endpoint?\n- AI Tutor: Good question — endpoints of the domain are a special but simple case.\n\nIf c is an endpoint of the domain (so values only exist on one side of c), you treat the missing one-sided limit as not applicable. Continuity at c then requires that the one existing one-sided limit equals f(c).\n\nMore concretely:\n- If the domain includes values only for x ≥ c (left endpoint), check the right-hand limit lim_{x→c+} f(x). If f(c) is defined, continuity at c means lim_{x→c+} f(x) = f(c). (The left-hand limit lim_{x→c-} is not applicable.)\n- If the domain includes values only for x ≤ c (right endpoint), check the left-hand limit lim_{x→c-} f(x). Continuity at c means lim_{x→c-} f(x) = f(c). (The right-hand limit is not applicable.)\n\nIn short: at a domain endpoint you only require the one relevant one-sided limit to match f(c). If f(c) is not defined, you cannot have continuity at that endpoint (unless you extend the function by defining f(c) equal to the existing one-sided limit). \n\nWould you like a quick example of checking continuity at a domain endpoint?\n- You: Thanks — that clarification helped. I see that at a domain endpoint I only need the existing one-sided limit to match f(c). One quick follow-up: if the endpoint is included in a piecewise definition but the formula there is something like a fraction that becomes undefined at c (so f(c) isn't actually defined even though the inequality includes c), do we treat that the same as \"f(c) not defined\" and therefore say it's discontinuous unless the one-sided limit exists and we redefine f(c)? In other words, inclusion by the interval doesn't override the function being undefined at that point — right?\n- AI Tutor: Right — inclusion by the interval does not override the actual formula failing to produce a value at that point. If the piece that \"contains\" c has a formula that is undefined at c (like a division by zero, a logarithm of a nonpositive number, etc.), then f(c) is not defined in practice, even if the interval symbol includes c. You should treat that the same as any other point where f(c) is not defined.\n\nSo you proceed this way:\n- First check whether the formula for the piece that supposedly defines f(c) actually yields a finite value at c.

If the one-sided limits do not agree (or don't exist), the point is a discontinuity.\n\nExample to keep in mind: Suppose a piece is defined as (x^2 − 1)/(x − 1) for x ≤ 1. The algebraic expression is undefined at x = 1, even though the interval includes 1. You should note f(1) is not defined unless the definition separately specifies a value at 1. However, the one-sided limit (from the left) of that expression as x → 1− equals 2 (because the fraction simplifies to x+1 for x ≠ 1). So you could say the left-hand limit exists and equals 2, but f(1) is undefined — the function is not continuous at 1 unless you define f(1) = 2.\n\nWould you like to try a short example where the formula is undefined at the endpoint so you can apply these steps?\n- You: Thanks — that clarification really helped.

If you are forming algebraic equations to enforce continuity (i.e., setting left-hand limit = right-hand limit), it is safe and often simpler to simplify each expression first (valid for x ≠ c) and then substitute c to get the limit values to equate. This is the usual, reliable method when the simplifications do not depend on unknowns making denominators zero at c.\n\n4. Caution cases to watch for:\n   - If simplifying introduces division by an expression that might be zero for some values of the unknown constants, you must check those parameter values separately. For example, if simplification cancels a factor that contains the unknown constant, the cancellation might be invalid for certain constant values; always ensure the canceled factor is nonzero given the unknowns' values, or handle the special cases separately.\n   - If the original piece's formula truly fails to be defined at c (division by zero etc.), remember f(c) is still undefined unless explicitly given — simplification does not define f(c), it only gives the limit.\n\n5. Practical rule of thumb:\n   - Simplify each side (for x ≠ c), compute the one-sided limits by substituting c into the simplified forms, set those limits equal, and solve for unknowns.\n   - After solving, verify that your solution doesn't make any denominator (or other restricted expression) zero in the original formulas at values of x near c (which could invalidate the simplification step). If it does, handle that special case separately.\n\nWould you like to try a quick example where simplification cancels a factor so you can practice both the usual method and checking special cases?\n- You: Thanks — that explanation helped me learn the nuance about cancellations depending on unknown constants. One quick confirmation: after I solve the equations produced by equating the one-sided limits (using simplified forms), the final extra check should be to substitute the found parameter values back into the original piecewise formulas and verify no denominator (or other undefined expression) is zero for x near the boundary — is that the complete post-solution check, or should I also explicitly test the original unsimplified expressions at the boundary point itself?\n- AI Tutor: Good attention to detail — that's exactly the right idea, and you're mostly done with the checks. Here's a concise checklist of what to do after you solve for the parameters; follow these to be thorough and avoid subtle mistakes:\n\n1. Substitute the found parameter values into the original piecewise formulas.\n2. Check the one-sided limits near the boundary by substituting the boundary value into the simplified forms (these give the limits because simplification is valid for x ≠ c). Confirm they are equal (this should hold because you solved for that).\n3. Check the original (unsimplified) formulas for any expressions that are undefined at or near c:\n   - Verify no denominator becomes zero for x values arbitrarily close to c on the side where that piece is used.\n   - Verify there are no other domain issues (like logs of nonpositive numbers, square roots of negatives, etc.) for x near c.\n4. Check whether f(c) is actually defined in the piecewise definition:\n   - If the interval inclusion gives f(c) (≤ or ≥) and the substituted formula is defined at c, compute f(c) and verify it equals the common one-sided limit.\n   - If the piece's formula is undefined at c (even if the interval includes c), then f(c) is not defined; in that case the original function is still discontinuous at c until you explicitly define f(c) equal to the common limit. Note this does not contradict solving for parameters to make the limits equal — it only means you must define f(c) afterward to make the function continuous as written.\n5. If any parameter value you found makes a denominator zero (or otherwise causes the expression to be undefined) at x values arbitrarily close to c for the relevant side, you must treat that as a special case. Either:\n   - reject that parameter value if it prevents the required limit from existing, or\n   - analyze it separately to see whether the limit still exists (often it won't).\n\nIn short: yes — substitute parameter values back into the original formulas and check for undefined behavior near the boundary; additionally, explicitly check f(c) (if the interval includes c) to ensure it matches the one-sided limits. Those steps together constitute the complete post-solution check.\n\n# Your Message Style\n## Interaction Style\n- Length of User Message: The user's query/response is always around 20 words.\n\n# Task\nGenerate your next message following these rules:\n1.

In summary, when checking continuity at a boundary point c:\n\n1. Check whether f(c) is defined by looking at the interval endpoints (≤ / ≥ vs < / >).

One question: if the boundary point is also the domain endpoint (so only one side of x exists in the domain), do I treat the absent side as \"not applicable\" or do I still require the existing one-sided limit to equal f(c) for continuity at that endpoint?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Good question — endpoints of the domain are a special but simple case.\n\nIf c is an endpoint of the domain (so values only exist on one side of c), you treat the missing one-sided limit as not applicable. Continuity at c then requires that the one existing one-sided limit equals f(c).\n\nMore concretely:\n- If the domain includes values only for x ≥ c (left endpoint), check the right-hand limit lim_{x→c+} f(x). If f(c) is defined, continuity at c means lim_{x→c+} f(x) = f(c). (The left-hand limit lim_{x→c-} is not applicable.)\n- If the domain includes values only for x ≤ c (right endpoint), check the left-hand limit lim_{x→c-} f(x). Continuity at c means lim_{x→c-} f(x) = f(c). (The right-hand limit is not applicable.)\n\nIn short: at a domain endpoint you only require the one relevant one-sided limit to match f(c). If f(c) is not defined, you cannot have continuity at that endpoint (unless you extend the function by defining f(c) equal to the existing one-sided limit). \n\nWould you like a quick example of checking continuity at a domain endpoint?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thanks — that clarification helped. I see that at a domain endpoint I only need the existing one-sided limit to match f(c). One quick follow-up: if the endpoint is included in a piecewise definition but the formula there is something like a fraction that becomes undefined at c (so f(c) isn't actually defined even though the inequality includes c), do we treat that the same as \"f(c) not defined\" and therefore say it's discontinuous unless the one-sided limit exists and we redefine f(c)? In other words, inclusion by the interval doesn't override the function being undefined at that point — right?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Right — inclusion by the interval does not override the actual formula failing to produce a value at that point. If the piece that \"contains\" c has a formula that is undefined at c (like a division by zero, a logarithm of a nonpositive number, etc.), then f(c) is not defined in practice, even if the interval symbol includes c. You should treat that the same as any other point where f(c) is not defined.\n\nSo you proceed this way:\n- First check whether the formula for the piece that supposedly defines f(c) actually yields a finite value at c. If it does, that is f(c).\n- If the formula is undefined at c, then f(c) is not defined (unless the problem explicitly states some defined value at c).\n- For continuity:\n  - If f(c) is defined, require the relevant one-sided limits equal f(c) (or both one-sided limits equal f(c) if c is an interior point).\n  - If f(c) is not defined, continuity at c would require the one-sided limits (the ones that make sense given the domain) to exist and be equal; then you could define f(c) to be that common limit to make the function continuous there. If the one-sided limits do not agree (or don't exist), the point is a discontinuity.\n\nExample to keep in mind: Suppose a piece is defined as (x^2 − 1)/(x − 1) for x ≤ 1. The algebraic expression is undefined at x = 1, even though the interval includes 1. You should note f(1) is not defined unless the definition separately specifies a value at 1. However, the one-sided limit (from the left) of that expression as x → 1− equals 2 (because the fraction simplifies to x+1 for x ≠ 1). So you could say the left-hand limit exists and equals 2, but f(1) is undefined — the function is not continuous at 1 unless you define f(1) = 2.\n\nWould you like to try a short example where the formula is undefined at the endpoint so you can apply these steps?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thanks — that clarification really helped. One quick question: when a formula is undefined at c but the one-sided limits both exist and are equal (a removable discontinuity), is it correct that we say the original function is discontinuous at c but can be made continuous by defining f(c) equal to that common limit? And in practice, when solving for unknown constants to enforce continuity across a boundary, I can treat f(c) as “not defined” initially and instead set the left- and right-hand expressions equal to each other (ignoring f(c)) to get the equation. Is that the right procedure every time in removable-discontinuity cases?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes — that's all correct. A few precise points to keep your understanding exact:\n\n- If the formula at c is undefined (so f(c) is not actually a value), then the function as written is discontinuous at c, even if both one-sided limits exist and are equal. That kind of discontinuity is called removable because you can \"remove\" it by defining f(c) to be the common limit.\n\n- In solving for unknown constants to enforce continuity at a boundary where the function currently has no defined value at c, the right procedure is exactly what you described: require the left-hand limit and right-hand limit to be equal. Concretely, pick the piece valid for x < c, evaluate its formula as x → c− (usually by direct substitution if it's a polynomial/rational expression that's defined at c), pick the piece valid for x > c and evaluate as x → c+, and set those two expressions equal. Solve for the unknown(s). After that, defining f(c) to be that common value yields a continuous function at c.\n\n- If f(c) is defined but the formula gives an indeterminate/undefined expression at c, treat f(c) as not defined (unless the problem explicitly gives a value) and follow the same approach above.\n\n- Small caution: when dealing with rational expressions that simplify to a continuous expression except at c, you can often simplify first (noting equivalence for x ≠ c) and then substitute the limit value; but remember that simplification doesn't retroactively define f(c). You still must check and (if required) specify f(c).\n\nWould you like to practice this with a short example where you solve for a constant that removes a discontinuity?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thanks — that cleared up my confusion about inclusion vs. actual definability at c. One more quick thing: when the left- and right-hand expressions are algebraically different but both simplify to the same value at c (for example one side simplifies after canceling a factor that’s zero at c), is it always safe to directly substitute c into each simplified form when forming the equation for continuity? Or should I keep the original unsimplified expressions and only simplify after equating them? Which is the more reliable step to avoid mistakes when solving for unknown constants?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Good question — being careful here avoids mistakes. Short answer: either approach can work, but you must keep track of where algebraic simplifications are valid. Here's a reliable procedure and the reason behind it:\n\n1. Identify which piece applies on each side of c (x < c and x > c). For each piece, consider the expression as defining the function for values not equal to c (i.e., in a neighborhood excluding c if necessary).\n\n2. For computing the one-sided limits, you may simplify each piece first (cancel factors, factor polynomials, etc.) as long as you remember that simplification is only valid for x values where the canceled factor is not zero.

Which function values should I compare at x = 2 and x = -2?\n- AI Tutor: Good — you're on the right track by thinking about the boundary points where the formula changes. Continuity at a boundary means the left-hand and right-hand limits (which for piecewise-defined simple formulas are just the function values from the appropriate pieces) agree there and equal the value of the function at that point.\n\nIdentify the two boundary points: x = 2 and x = −2.\n\n1. At x = 2:\n- For x > 2 the expression used is ax + 3, so the right-hand value at 2 is a·2 + 3 = 2a + 3.\n- For −2 ≤ x ≤ 2 the expression used at x = 2 is x − 5, so the value there is 2 − 5 = −3.\nContinuity at x = 2 requires the right-hand value equal the value at 2. Write that equation.\n\n2. At x = −2:\n- For −2 ≤ x ≤ 2 the expression at x = −2 is x − 5, so the value there is −2 − 5 = −7.\n- For x < −2 the expression used is 2x − b, so the left-hand value at −2 is 2(−2) − b = −4 − b.\nContinuity at x = −2 requires the left-hand value equal the value at −2. Write that equation.\n\nNow you have two equations in a and b. What are those equations? Solve them for a and b, then compute a + b. If you want, tell me the equations you wrote and your steps to solve them and I’ll check your work.\n- You: Okay — the equations I get are 2a + 3 = −3 (from x = 2) and −4 − b = −7 (from x = −2). Can you confirm those are set up correctly? Also, could you show the algebra to solve each for a and b and then compute a + b?\n- AI Tutor: You're correct about the two equations — those come from setting the appropriate piecewise expressions equal at the boundary points. Now try solving each equation step by step; I'll guide you and check your work.\n\nStart with 2a + 3 = −3. Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the 2a term: what do you get next? \n\nThen move to −4 − b = −7. Add 4 to both sides to isolate −b: what does that give you, and what is b after you multiply or change sign?\n\nAfter you find a and b, add them to get a + b. Tell me the values you obtain and I'll confirm.\n- You: After solving, a = −3 and b = 3, so a + b = 0.\n- AI Tutor: Exactly right. Quick check of your steps:\n\n- From 2a + 3 = −3: subtract 3 to get 2a = −6, so a = −3.\n- From −4 − b = −7: add 4 to get −b = −3, so b = 3.\n- Then a + b = −3 + 3 = 0.\n\nEverything is correct. Nicely done.\n- You: Thanks — that explanation helped. One quick question: when deciding which piece to use for the left- or right-hand value at a boundary, is the rule always \"use the piece valid for x just less than the boundary for the left-hand limit, and the piece valid for x just greater than the boundary for the right-hand limit\"? Just want to be sure I apply that correctly on future piecewise problems.\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that rule is exactly right and is the general way to handle piecewise functions at boundary points.\n\nMore precisely:\n- The left-hand limit at a point x = c uses the formula that applies for x values slightly less than c (the piece covering values just to the left of c).\n- The right-hand limit at x = c uses the formula that applies for x values slightly greater than c (the piece covering values just to the right of c).\n- If the function is defined at c, its actual value f(c) may come from one of the pieces (depending on how the piecewise definition specifies the intervals). For continuity you need left-hand limit = right-hand limit = f(c).\n\nA couple of quick reminders:\n- Pay attention to whether the interval endpoints in the piecewise definition are included (≤ or ≥) or excluded (< or >). That tells you which piece gives f(c) itself.\n- Even if f(c) is defined by only one piece, both one-sided limits must still match that value for continuity.\n- If one-sided limits differ, the function has a jump discontinuity at c.\n\nIf you want, I can give a short example with different endpoint inclusions so you can practice identifying which piece to use for left, right, and f(c). Which would you prefer?\n- You: Thanks — that makes sense and I see how to pick the pieces for left and right limits now. Quick follow-up: if the piecewise definition uses strict inequalities on both sides (so f(c) isn't defined by either piece), we still just compare the left- and right-hand expressions — do we then say the function is discontinuous at c unless those two one-sided limits happen to be equal? Is that the right way to state it?\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that's exactly right. If f(c) is not defined (because neither piece includes x = c), then for continuity at c you'd need both one-sided limits to exist and be equal; only then could you extend f to be continuous there by defining f(c) equal to that common value. If the left- and right-hand limits are different (or one/both fail to exist), the function has a discontinuity at c and you cannot make it continuous at c without changing the function.\n\nMore compactly:\n- If f(c) is defined: continuity at c requires left-hand limit = right-hand limit = f(c).\n- If f(c) is not defined: continuity at c would require left-hand limit = right-hand limit (and then you could define f(c) to be that common value to make it continuous). If the one-sided limits differ, the point is a jump discontinuity.\n\nGood thinking — do you want an example where f(c) isn't defined so you can practice deciding whether the limits match?\n- You: Thanks — that cleared it up. One quick thing I'd like to confirm: when checking continuity at a boundary I should first note which inequalities include the endpoint (≤ or ≥) to identify f(c) if it’s defined, then independently pick the piece for x<c for the left-hand limit and the piece for x>c for the right-hand limit, and finally compare left, right, and f(c) (if present). Is that the complete checklist I should use every time?\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that checklist is complete and a reliable procedure to follow every time. In summary, when checking continuity at a boundary point c:\n\n1. Check whether f(c) is defined by looking at the interval endpoints (≤ / ≥ vs < / >). If included, determine f(c) from the piece that contains c.\n2. For the left-hand limit, use the formula that applies for x values just less than c (the piece covering x < c near c).\n3. For the right-hand limit, use the formula that applies for x values just greater than c (the piece covering x > c near c).\n4. Compare:\n   - If f(c) is defined: require left-hand limit = right-hand limit = f(c).\n   - If f(c) is not defined: require left-hand limit = right-hand limit in order for the function to be extendable to a continuous function at c; otherwise it's discontinuous.\n\nExtra tips:\n- Watch endpoint inclusions carefully — they determine which piece gives f(c).\n- You can compute the one-sided limits by directly substituting c into the corresponding formulas when those formulas are polynomials/linear (or otherwise continuous on their intervals).\n- If either one-sided limit does not exist, the function is discontinuous at c.\n\nWould you like a quick example to practice this checklist?\n- You: Thanks — that checklist makes sense and I see how to apply it. One question: if the boundary point is also the domain endpoint (so only one side of x exists in the domain), do I treat the absent side as \"not applicable\" or do I still require the existing one-sided limit to equal f(c) for continuity at that endpoint?\n- AI Tutor: Good question — endpoints of the domain are a special but simple case.\n\nIf c is an endpoint of the domain (so values only exist on one side of c), you treat the missing one-sided limit as not applicable. Continuity at c then requires that the one existing one-sided limit equals f(c).\n\nMore concretely:\n- If the domain includes values only for x ≥ c (left endpoint), check the right-hand limit lim_{x→c+} f(x). If f(c) is defined, continuity at c means lim_{x→c+} f(x) = f(c). (The left-hand limit lim_{x→c-} is not applicable.)\n- If the domain includes values only for x ≤ c (right endpoint), check the left-hand limit lim_{x→c-} f(x). Continuity at c means lim_{x→c-} f(x) = f(c). (The right-hand limit is not applicable.)\n\nIn short: at a domain endpoint you only require the one relevant one-sided limit to match f(c). If f(c) is not defined, you cannot have continuity at that endpoint (unless you extend the function by defining f(c) equal to the existing one-sided limit). \n\nWould you like a quick example of checking continuity at a domain endpoint?\n- You: Thanks — that clarification helped. I see that at a domain endpoint I only need the existing one-sided limit to match f(c). One quick follow-up: if the endpoint is included in a piecewise definition but the formula there is something like a fraction that becomes undefined at c (so f(c) isn't actually defined even though the inequality includes c), do we treat that the same as \"f(c) not defined\" and therefore say it's discontinuous unless the one-sided limit exists and we redefine f(c)? In other words, inclusion by the interval doesn't override the function being undefined at that point — right?\n- AI Tutor: Right — inclusion by the interval does not override the actual formula failing to produce a value at that point. If the piece that \"contains\" c has a formula that is undefined at c (like a division by zero, a logarithm of a nonpositive number, etc.), then f(c) is not defined in practice, even if the interval symbol includes c. You should treat that the same as any other point where f(c) is not defined.\n\nSo you proceed this way:\n- First check whether the formula for the piece that supposedly defines f(c) actually yields a finite value at c. If it does, that is f(c).\n- If the formula is undefined at c, then f(c) is not defined (unless the problem explicitly states some defined value at c).\n- For continuity:\n  - If f(c) is defined, require the relevant one-sided limits equal f(c) (or both one-sided limits equal f(c) if c is an interior point).\n  - If f(c) is not defined, continuity at c would require the one-sided limits (the ones that make sense given the domain) to exist and be equal; then you could define f(c) to be that common limit to make the function continuous there. If the one-sided limits do not agree (or don't exist), the point is a discontinuity.\n\nExample to keep in mind: Suppose a piece is defined as (x^2 − 1)/(x − 1) for x ≤ 1. The algebraic expression is undefined at x = 1, even though the interval includes 1. You should note f(1) is not defined unless the definition separately specifies a value at 1. However, the one-sided limit (from the left) of that expression as x → 1− equals 2 (because the fraction simplifies to x+1 for x ≠ 1). So you could say the left-hand limit exists and equals 2, but f(1) is undefined — the function is not continuous at 1 unless you define f(1) = 2.\n\nWould you like to try a short example where the formula is undefined at the endpoint so you can apply these steps?\n- You: Thanks — that clarification really helped. One quick question: when a formula is undefined at c but the one-sided limits both exist and are equal (a removable discontinuity), is it correct that we say the original function is discontinuous at c but can be made continuous by defining f(c) equal to that common limit? And in practice, when solving for unknown constants to enforce continuity across a boundary, I can treat f(c) as “not defined” initially and instead set the left- and right-hand expressions equal to each other (ignoring f(c)) to get the equation. Is that the right procedure every time in removable-discontinuity cases?\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that's all correct. A few precise points to keep your understanding exact:\n\n- If the formula at c is undefined (so f(c) is not actually a value), then the function as written is discontinuous at c, even if both one-sided limits exist and are equal. That kind of discontinuity is called removable because you can \"remove\" it by defining f(c) to be the common limit.\n\n- In solving for unknown constants to enforce continuity at a boundary where the function currently has no defined value at c, the right procedure is exactly what you described: require the left-hand limit and right-hand limit to be equal. Concretely, pick the piece valid for x < c, evaluate its formula as x → c− (usually by direct substitution if it's a polynomial/rational expression that's defined at c), pick the piece valid for x > c and evaluate as x → c+, and set those two expressions equal. Solve for the unknown(s). After that, defining f(c) to be that common value yields a continuous function at c.\n\n- If f(c) is defined but the formula gives an indeterminate/undefined expression at c, treat f(c) as not defined (unless the problem explicitly gives a value) and follow the same approach above.\n\n- Small caution: when dealing with rational expressions that simplify to a continuous expression except at c, you can often simplify first (noting equivalence for x ≠ c) and then substitute the limit value; but remember that simplification doesn't retroactively define f(c). You still must check and (if required) specify f(c).\n\nWould you like to practice this with a short example where you solve for a constant that removes a discontinuity?\n- You: Thanks — that cleared up my confusion about inclusion vs. actual definability at c. One more quick thing: when the left- and right-hand expressions are algebraically different but both simplify to the same value at c (for example one side simplifies after canceling a factor that’s zero at c), is it always safe to directly substitute c into each simplified form when forming the equation for continuity? Or should I keep the original unsimplified expressions and only simplify after equating them? Which is the more reliable step to avoid mistakes when solving for unknown constants?\n- AI Tutor: Good question — being careful here avoids mistakes. Short answer: either approach can work, but you must keep track of where algebraic simplifications are valid. Here's a reliable procedure and the reason behind it:\n\n1. Identify which piece applies on each side of c (x < c and x > c). For each piece, consider the expression as defining the function for values not equal to c (i.e., in a neighborhood excluding c if necessary).\n\n2. For computing the one-sided limits, you may simplify each piece first (cancel factors, factor polynomials, etc.) as long as you remember that simplification is only valid for x values where the canceled factor is not zero. That is fine because one-sided limits look at x approaching c but not equaling c, so simplifications that are valid for x ≠ c are allowed when evaluating the limit.\n\n   - Example: if a piece is (x^2 − 1)/(x − 1) for x < 1, you can simplify to x + 1 for x ≠ 1 and then substitute x = 1 to get the left-hand limit 2.\n\n3. If you are forming algebraic equations to enforce continuity (i.e., setting left-hand limit = right-hand limit), it is safe and often simpler to simplify each expression first (valid for x ≠ c) and then substitute c to get the limit values to equate. This is the usual, reliable method when the simplifications do not depend on unknowns making denominators zero at c.\n\n4. Caution cases to watch for:\n   - If simplifying introduces division by an expression that might be zero for some values of the unknown constants, you must check those parameter values separately. For example, if simplification cancels a factor that contains the unknown constant, the cancellation might be invalid for certain constant values; always ensure the canceled factor is nonzero given the unknowns' values, or handle the special cases separately.\n   - If the original piece's formula truly fails to be defined at c (division by zero etc.), remember f(c) is still undefined unless explicitly given — simplification does not define f(c), it only gives the limit.\n\n5. Practical rule of thumb:\n   - Simplify each side (for x ≠ c), compute the one-sided limits by substituting c into the simplified forms, set those limits equal, and solve for unknowns.\n   - After solving, verify that your solution doesn't make any denominator (or other restricted expression) zero in the original formulas at values of x near c (which could invalidate the simplification step). If it does, handle that special case separately.\n\nWould you like to try a quick example where simplification cancels a factor so you can practice both the usual method and checking special cases?\n- You: Thanks — that explanation helped me learn the nuance about cancellations depending on unknown constants. One quick confirmation: after I solve the equations produced by equating the one-sided limits (using simplified forms), the final extra check should be to substitute the found parameter values back into the original piecewise formulas and verify no denominator (or other undefined expression) is zero for x near the boundary — is that the complete post-solution check, or should I also explicitly test the original unsimplified expressions at the boundary point itself?\n- AI Tutor: Good attention to detail — that's exactly the right idea, and you're mostly done with the checks. Here's a concise checklist of what to do after you solve for the parameters; follow these to be thorough and avoid subtle mistakes:\n\n1. Substitute the found parameter values into the original piecewise formulas.\n2. Check the one-sided limits near the boundary by substituting the boundary value into the simplified forms (these give the limits because simplification is valid for x ≠ c). Confirm they are equal (this should hold because you solved for that).\n3. Check the original (unsimplified) formulas for any expressions that are undefined at or near c:\n   - Verify no denominator becomes zero for x values arbitrarily close to c on the side where that piece is used.\n   - Verify there are no other domain issues (like logs of nonpositive numbers, square roots of negatives, etc.) for x near c.\n4. Check whether f(c) is actually defined in the piecewise definition:\n   - If the interval inclusion gives f(c) (≤ or ≥) and the substituted formula is defined at c, compute f(c) and verify it equals the common one-sided limit.\n   - If the piece's formula is undefined at c (even if the interval includes c), then f(c) is not defined; in that case the original function is still discontinuous at c until you explicitly define f(c) equal to the common limit. Note this does not contradict solving for parameters to make the limits equal — it only means you must define f(c) afterward to make the function continuous as written.\n5. If any parameter value you found makes a denominator zero (or otherwise causes the expression to be undefined) at x values arbitrarily close to c for the relevant side, you must treat that as a special case. Either:\n   - reject that parameter value if it prevents the required limit from existing, or\n   - analyze it separately to see whether the limit still exists (often it won't).\n\nIn short: yes — substitute parameter values back into the original formulas and check for undefined behavior near the boundary; additionally, explicitly check f(c) (if the interval includes c) to ensure it matches the one-sided limits. Those steps together constitute the complete post-solution check.\n- You: Thanks — that checklist cleared up my last uncertainty. I understand now to (1) simplify to compute one-sided limits, (2) set them equal to solve for parameters, and then (3) substitute those parameter values back into the original unsimplified pieces to check for any domain issues and to confirm whether f(c) is actually defined and equals the common limit. One quick confirmation: if after substituting the parameters the original piece that supposedly defines f(c) is undefined at c, then I should report the function as discontinuous at c unless the problem explicitly tells me to redefine f(c). Is that the correct final takeaway?\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that's the correct final takeaway.\n\nTo restate succinctly:\n- If the piecewise definition (after substituting solved parameters) gives a concrete finite value at c (the formula is defined there and the interval includes c), then continuity at c requires that value to equal the common one-sided limit.\n- If the piecewise definition does not actually produce a value at c (the formula is undefined at c, even if the interval symbol includes c), then as written the function is discontinuous at c. It can be made continuous only by explicitly defining f(c) to be the common one-sided limit (if that common limit exists).\n- If the one-sided limits themselves do not agree, the function has a nonremovable (jump) discontinuity at c and cannot be made continuous there by merely defining f(c).\n\nYou've got the right procedure and conclusion — well done.\n\n# Your Message Style\n## Interaction Style\n- Length of User Message: The user's query/response is always around 20 words.\n\n# Task\nGenerate your next message following these rules:\n1.

Which function values should I compare at x = 2 and x = -2?\n- AI Tutor: Good — you're on the right track by thinking about the boundary points where the formula changes. Continuity at a boundary means the left-hand and right-hand limits (which for piecewise-defined simple formulas are just the function values from the appropriate pieces) agree there and equal the value of the function at that point.\n\nIdentify the two boundary points: x = 2 and x = −2.\n\n1. At x = 2:\n- For x > 2 the expression used is ax + 3, so the right-hand value at 2 is a·2 + 3 = 2a + 3.\n- For −2 ≤ x ≤ 2 the expression used at x = 2 is x − 5, so the value there is 2 − 5 = −3.\nContinuity at x = 2 requires the right-hand value equal the value at 2. Write that equation.\n\n2. At x = −2:\n- For −2 ≤ x ≤ 2 the expression at x = −2 is x − 5, so the value there is −2 − 5 = −7.\n- For x < −2 the expression used is 2x − b, so the left-hand value at −2 is 2(−2) − b = −4 − b.\nContinuity at x = −2 requires the left-hand value equal the value at −2. Write that equation.\n\nNow you have two equations in a and b. What are those equations? Solve them for a and b, then compute a + b. If you want, tell me the equations you wrote and your steps to solve them and I’ll check your work.\n- You: Okay — the equations I get are 2a + 3 = −3 (from x = 2) and −4 − b = −7 (from x = −2). Can you confirm those are set up correctly? Also, could you show the algebra to solve each for a and b and then compute a + b?\n- AI Tutor: You're correct about the two equations — those come from setting the appropriate piecewise expressions equal at the boundary points. Now try solving each equation step by step; I'll guide you and check your work.\n\nStart with 2a + 3 = −3. Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the 2a term: what do you get next? \n\nThen move to −4 − b = −7. Add 4 to both sides to isolate −b: what does that give you, and what is b after you multiply or change sign?\n\nAfter you find a and b, add them to get a + b. Tell me the values you obtain and I'll confirm.\n- You: After solving, a = −3 and b = 3, so a + b = 0.\n- AI Tutor: Exactly right. Quick check of your steps:\n\n- From 2a + 3 = −3: subtract 3 to get 2a = −6, so a = −3.\n- From −4 − b = −7: add 4 to get −b = −3, so b = 3.\n- Then a + b = −3 + 3 = 0.\n\nEverything is correct. Nicely done.\n- You: Thanks — that explanation helped. One quick question: when deciding which piece to use for the left- or right-hand value at a boundary, is the rule always \"use the piece valid for x just less than the boundary for the left-hand limit, and the piece valid for x just greater than the boundary for the right-hand limit\"? Just want to be sure I apply that correctly on future piecewise problems.\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that rule is exactly right and is the general way to handle piecewise functions at boundary points.\n\nMore precisely:\n- The left-hand limit at a point x = c uses the formula that applies for x values slightly less than c (the piece covering values just to the left of c).\n- The right-hand limit at x = c uses the formula that applies for x values slightly greater than c (the piece covering values just to the right of c).\n- If the function is defined at c, its actual value f(c) may come from one of the pieces (depending on how the piecewise definition specifies the intervals). For continuity you need left-hand limit = right-hand limit = f(c).\n\nA couple of quick reminders:\n- Pay attention to whether the interval endpoints in the piecewise definition are included (≤ or ≥) or excluded (< or >). That tells you which piece gives f(c) itself.\n- Even if f(c) is defined by only one piece, both one-sided limits must still match that value for continuity.\n- If one-sided limits differ, the function has a jump discontinuity at c.\n\nIf you want, I can give a short example with different endpoint inclusions so you can practice identifying which piece to use for left, right, and f(c). Which would you prefer?\n- You: Thanks — that makes sense and I see how to pick the pieces for left and right limits now. Quick follow-up: if the piecewise definition uses strict inequalities on both sides (so f(c) isn't defined by either piece), we still just compare the left- and right-hand expressions — do we then say the function is discontinuous at c unless those two one-sided limits happen to be equal? Is that the right way to state it?\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that's exactly right. If f(c) is not defined (because neither piece includes x = c), then for continuity at c you'd need both one-sided limits to exist and be equal; only then could you extend f to be continuous there by defining f(c) equal to that common value. If the left- and right-hand limits are different (or one/both fail to exist), the function has a discontinuity at c and you cannot make it continuous at c without changing the function.\n\nMore compactly:\n- If f(c) is defined: continuity at c requires left-hand limit = right-hand limit = f(c).\n- If f(c) is not defined: continuity at c would require left-hand limit = right-hand limit (and then you could define f(c) to be that common value to make it continuous). If the one-sided limits differ, the point is a jump discontinuity.\n\nGood thinking — do you want an example where f(c) isn't defined so you can practice deciding whether the limits match?\n- You: Thanks — that cleared it up. One quick thing I'd like to confirm: when checking continuity at a boundary I should first note which inequalities include the endpoint (≤ or ≥) to identify f(c) if it’s defined, then independently pick the piece for x<c for the left-hand limit and the piece for x>c for the right-hand limit, and finally compare left, right, and f(c) (if present). Is that the complete checklist I should use every time?\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that checklist is complete and a reliable procedure to follow every time. In summary, when checking continuity at a boundary point c:\n\n1. Check whether f(c) is defined by looking at the interval endpoints (≤ / ≥ vs < / >). If included, determine f(c) from the piece that contains c.\n2. For the left-hand limit, use the formula that applies for x values just less than c (the piece covering x < c near c).\n3. For the right-hand limit, use the formula that applies for x values just greater than c (the piece covering x > c near c).\n4. Compare:\n   - If f(c) is defined: require left-hand limit = right-hand limit = f(c).\n   - If f(c) is not defined: require left-hand limit = right-hand limit in order for the function to be extendable to a continuous function at c; otherwise it's discontinuous.\n\nExtra tips:\n- Watch endpoint inclusions carefully — they determine which piece gives f(c).\n- You can compute the one-sided limits by directly substituting c into the corresponding formulas when those formulas are polynomials/linear (or otherwise continuous on their intervals).\n- If either one-sided limit does not exist, the function is discontinuous at c.\n\nWould you like a quick example to practice this checklist?\n- You: Thanks — that checklist makes sense and I see how to apply it. One question: if the boundary point is also the domain endpoint (so only one side of x exists in the domain), do I treat the absent side as \"not applicable\" or do I still require the existing one-sided limit to equal f(c) for continuity at that endpoint?\n- AI Tutor: Good question — endpoints of the domain are a special but simple case.\n\nIf c is an endpoint of the domain (so values only exist on one side of c), you treat the missing one-sided limit as not applicable. Continuity at c then requires that the one existing one-sided limit equals f(c).\n\nMore concretely:\n- If the domain includes values only for x ≥ c (left endpoint), check the right-hand limit lim_{x→c+} f(x). If f(c) is defined, continuity at c means lim_{x→c+} f(x) = f(c). (The left-hand limit lim_{x→c-} is not applicable.)\n- If the domain includes values only for x ≤ c (right endpoint), check the left-hand limit lim_{x→c-} f(x). Continuity at c means lim_{x→c-} f(x) = f(c). (The right-hand limit is not applicable.)\n\nIn short: at a domain endpoint you only require the one relevant one-sided limit to match f(c). If f(c) is not defined, you cannot have continuity at that endpoint (unless you extend the function by defining f(c) equal to the existing one-sided limit). \n\nWould you like a quick example of checking continuity at a domain endpoint?\n- You: Thanks — that clarification helped. I see that at a domain endpoint I only need the existing one-sided limit to match f(c). One quick follow-up: if the endpoint is included in a piecewise definition but the formula there is something like a fraction that becomes undefined at c (so f(c) isn't actually defined even though the inequality includes c), do we treat that the same as \"f(c) not defined\" and therefore say it's discontinuous unless the one-sided limit exists and we redefine f(c)? In other words, inclusion by the interval doesn't override the function being undefined at that point — right?\n- AI Tutor: Right — inclusion by the interval does not override the actual formula failing to produce a value at that point. If the piece that \"contains\" c has a formula that is undefined at c (like a division by zero, a logarithm of a nonpositive number, etc.), then f(c) is not defined in practice, even if the interval symbol includes c. You should treat that the same as any other point where f(c) is not defined.\n\nSo you proceed this way:\n- First check whether the formula for the piece that supposedly defines f(c) actually yields a finite value at c. If it does, that is f(c).\n- If the formula is undefined at c, then f(c) is not defined (unless the problem explicitly states some defined value at c).\n- For continuity:\n  - If f(c) is defined, require the relevant one-sided limits equal f(c) (or both one-sided limits equal f(c) if c is an interior point).\n  - If f(c) is not defined, continuity at c would require the one-sided limits (the ones that make sense given the domain) to exist and be equal; then you could define f(c) to be that common limit to make the function continuous there. If the one-sided limits do not agree (or don't exist), the point is a discontinuity.\n\nExample to keep in mind: Suppose a piece is defined as (x^2 − 1)/(x − 1) for x ≤ 1. The algebraic expression is undefined at x = 1, even though the interval includes 1. You should note f(1) is not defined unless the definition separately specifies a value at 1. However, the one-sided limit (from the left) of that expression as x → 1− equals 2 (because the fraction simplifies to x+1 for x ≠ 1). So you could say the left-hand limit exists and equals 2, but f(1) is undefined — the function is not continuous at 1 unless you define f(1) = 2.\n\nWould you like to try a short example where the formula is undefined at the endpoint so you can apply these steps?\n- You: Thanks — that clarification really helped. One quick question: when a formula is undefined at c but the one-sided limits both exist and are equal (a removable discontinuity), is it correct that we say the original function is discontinuous at c but can be made continuous by defining f(c) equal to that common limit?

Practical rule of thumb:\n   - Simplify each side (for x ≠ c), compute the one-sided limits by substituting c into the simplified forms, set those limits equal, and solve for unknowns.\n   - After solving, verify that your solution doesn't make any denominator (or other restricted expression) zero in the original formulas at values of x near c (which could invalidate the simplification step).

One quick confirmation: after I solve the equations produced by equating the one-sided limits (using simplified forms), the final extra check should be to substitute the found parameter values back into the original piecewise formulas and verify no denominator (or other undefined expression) is zero for x near the boundary — is that the complete post-solution check, or should I also explicitly test the original unsimplified expressions at the boundary point itself?\n- AI Tutor: Good attention to detail — that's exactly the right idea, and you're mostly done with the checks. Here's a concise checklist of what to do after you solve for the parameters; follow these to be thorough and avoid subtle mistakes:\n\n1. Substitute the found parameter values into the original piecewise formulas.\n2. Check the one-sided limits near the boundary by substituting the boundary value into the simplified forms (these give the limits because simplification is valid for x ≠ c). Confirm they are equal (this should hold because you solved for that).\n3. Check the original (unsimplified) formulas for any expressions that are undefined at or near c:\n   - Verify no denominator becomes zero for x values arbitrarily close to c on the side where that piece is used.\n   - Verify there are no other domain issues (like logs of nonpositive numbers, square roots of negatives, etc.) for x near c.\n4. Check whether f(c) is actually defined in the piecewise definition:\n   - If the interval inclusion gives f(c) (≤ or ≥) and the substituted formula is defined at c, compute f(c) and verify it equals the common one-sided limit.\n   - If the piece's formula is undefined at c (even if the interval includes c), then f(c) is not defined; in that case the original function is still discontinuous at c until you explicitly define f(c) equal to the common limit. Note this does not contradict solving for parameters to make the limits equal — it only means you must define f(c) afterward to make the function continuous as written.\n5. If any parameter value you found makes a denominator zero (or otherwise causes the expression to be undefined) at x values arbitrarily close to c for the relevant side, you must treat that as a special case. Either:\n   - reject that parameter value if it prevents the required limit from existing, or\n   - analyze it separately to see whether the limit still exists (often it won't).\n\nIn short: yes — substitute parameter values back into the original formulas and check for undefined behavior near the boundary; additionally, explicitly check f(c) (if the interval includes c) to ensure it matches the one-sided limits. Those steps together constitute the complete post-solution check.\n- You: Thanks — that checklist cleared up my last uncertainty. I understand now to (1) simplify to compute one-sided limits, (2) set them equal to solve for parameters, and then (3) substitute those parameter values back into the original unsimplified pieces to check for any domain issues and to confirm whether f(c) is actually defined and equals the common limit. One quick confirmation: if after substituting the parameters the original piece that supposedly defines f(c) is undefined at c, then I should report the function as discontinuous at c unless the problem explicitly tells me to redefine f(c). Is that the correct final takeaway?\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that's the correct final takeaway.\n\nTo restate succinctly:\n- If the piecewise definition (after substituting solved parameters) gives a concrete finite value at c (the formula is defined there and the interval includes c), then continuity at c requires that value to equal the common one-sided limit.\n- If the piecewise definition does not actually produce a value at c (the formula is undefined at c, even if the interval symbol includes c), then as written the function is discontinuous at c. It can be made continuous only by explicitly defining f(c) to be the common one-sided limit (if that common limit exists).\n- If the one-sided limits themselves do not agree, the function has a nonremovable (jump) discontinuity at c and cannot be made continuous there by merely defining f(c).\n\nYou've got the right procedure and conclusion — well done.\n\n# Your Message Style\n## Interaction Style\n- Length of User Message: The user's query/response is always around 20 words.\n\n# Task\nGenerate your next message following these rules:\n1.

One question: if the boundary point is also the domain endpoint (so only one side of x exists in the domain), do I treat the absent side as \"not applicable\" or do I still require the existing one-sided limit to equal f(c) for continuity at that endpoint?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Good question — endpoints of the domain are a special but simple case.\n\nIf c is an endpoint of the domain (so values only exist on one side of c), you treat the missing one-sided limit as not applicable. Continuity at c then requires that the one existing one-sided limit equals f(c).\n\nMore concretely:\n- If the domain includes values only for x ≥ c (left endpoint), check the right-hand limit lim_{x→c+} f(x). If f(c) is defined, continuity at c means lim_{x→c+} f(x) = f(c). (The left-hand limit lim_{x→c-} is not applicable.)\n- If the domain includes values only for x ≤ c (right endpoint), check the left-hand limit lim_{x→c-} f(x). Continuity at c means lim_{x→c-} f(x) = f(c). (The right-hand limit is not applicable.)\n\nIn short: at a domain endpoint you only require the one relevant one-sided limit to match f(c). If f(c) is not defined, you cannot have continuity at that endpoint (unless you extend the function by defining f(c) equal to the existing one-sided limit). \n\nWould you like a quick example of checking continuity at a domain endpoint?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thanks — that clarification helped. I see that at a domain endpoint I only need the existing one-sided limit to match f(c). One quick follow-up: if the endpoint is included in a piecewise definition but the formula there is something like a fraction that becomes undefined at c (so f(c) isn't actually defined even though the inequality includes c), do we treat that the same as \"f(c) not defined\" and therefore say it's discontinuous unless the one-sided limit exists and we redefine f(c)? In other words, inclusion by the interval doesn't override the function being undefined at that point — right?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Right — inclusion by the interval does not override the actual formula failing to produce a value at that point. If the piece that \"contains\" c has a formula that is undefined at c (like a division by zero, a logarithm of a nonpositive number, etc.), then f(c) is not defined in practice, even if the interval symbol includes c. You should treat that the same as any other point where f(c) is not defined.\n\nSo you proceed this way:\n- First check whether the formula for the piece that supposedly defines f(c) actually yields a finite value at c. If it does, that is f(c).\n- If the formula is undefined at c, then f(c) is not defined (unless the problem explicitly states some defined value at c).\n- For continuity:\n  - If f(c) is defined, require the relevant one-sided limits equal f(c) (or both one-sided limits equal f(c) if c is an interior point).\n  - If f(c) is not defined, continuity at c would require the one-sided limits (the ones that make sense given the domain) to exist and be equal; then you could define f(c) to be that common limit to make the function continuous there. If the one-sided limits do not agree (or don't exist), the point is a discontinuity.\n\nExample to keep in mind: Suppose a piece is defined as (x^2 − 1)/(x − 1) for x ≤ 1. The algebraic expression is undefined at x = 1, even though the interval includes 1. You should note f(1) is not defined unless the definition separately specifies a value at 1. However, the one-sided limit (from the left) of that expression as x → 1− equals 2 (because the fraction simplifies to x+1 for x ≠ 1). So you could say the left-hand limit exists and equals 2, but f(1) is undefined — the function is not continuous at 1 unless you define f(1) = 2.\n\nWould you like to try a short example where the formula is undefined at the endpoint so you can apply these steps?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thanks — that clarification really helped. One quick question: when a formula is undefined at c but the one-sided limits both exist and are equal (a removable discontinuity), is it correct that we say the original function is discontinuous at c but can be made continuous by defining f(c) equal to that common limit? And in practice, when solving for unknown constants to enforce continuity across a boundary, I can treat f(c) as “not defined” initially and instead set the left- and right-hand expressions equal to each other (ignoring f(c)) to get the equation. Is that the right procedure every time in removable-discontinuity cases?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes — that's all correct. A few precise points to keep your understanding exact:\n\n- If the formula at c is undefined (so f(c) is not actually a value), then the function as written is discontinuous at c, even if both one-sided limits exist and are equal. That kind of discontinuity is called removable because you can \"remove\" it by defining f(c) to be the common limit.\n\n- In solving for unknown constants to enforce continuity at a boundary where the function currently has no defined value at c, the right procedure is exactly what you described: require the left-hand limit and right-hand limit to be equal. Concretely, pick the piece valid for x < c, evaluate its formula as x → c− (usually by direct substitution if it's a polynomial/rational expression that's defined at c), pick the piece valid for x > c and evaluate as x → c+, and set those two expressions equal. Solve for the unknown(s). After that, defining f(c) to be that common value yields a continuous function at c.\n\n- If f(c) is defined but the formula gives an indeterminate/undefined expression at c, treat f(c) as not defined (unless the problem explicitly gives a value) and follow the same approach above.\n\n- Small caution: when dealing with rational expressions that simplify to a continuous expression except at c, you can often simplify first (noting equivalence for x ≠ c) and then substitute the limit value; but remember that simplification doesn't retroactively define f(c). You still must check and (if required) specify f(c).\n\nWould you like to practice this with a short example where you solve for a constant that removes a discontinuity?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thanks — that cleared up my confusion about inclusion vs. actual definability at c. One more quick thing: when the left- and right-hand expressions are algebraically different but both simplify to the same value at c (for example one side simplifies after canceling a factor that’s zero at c), is it always safe to directly substitute c into each simplified form when forming the equation for continuity? Or should I keep the original unsimplified expressions and only simplify after equating them? Which is the more reliable step to avoid mistakes when solving for unknown constants?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Good question — being careful here avoids mistakes. Short answer: either approach can work, but you must keep track of where algebraic simplifications are valid. Here's a reliable procedure and the reason behind it:\n\n1. Identify which piece applies on each side of c (x < c and x > c). For each piece, consider the expression as defining the function for values not equal to c (i.e., in a neighborhood excluding c if necessary).\n\n2. For computing the one-sided limits, you may simplify each piece first (cancel factors, factor polynomials, etc.) as long as you remember that simplification is only valid for x values where the canceled factor is not zero. That is fine because one-sided limits look at x approaching c but not equaling c, so simplifications that are valid for x ≠ c are allowed when evaluating the limit.\n\n   - Example: if a piece is (x^2 − 1)/(x − 1) for x < 1, you can simplify to x + 1 for x ≠ 1 and then substitute x = 1 to get the left-hand limit 2.\n\n3. If you are forming algebraic equations to enforce continuity (i.e., setting left-hand limit = right-hand limit), it is safe and often simpler to simplify each expression first (valid for x ≠ c) and then substitute c to get the limit values to equate. This is the usual, reliable method when the simplifications do not depend on unknowns making denominators zero at c.\n\n4. Caution cases to watch for:\n   - If simplifying introduces division by an expression that might be zero for some values of the unknown constants, you must check those parameter values separately.

Would you like that?\n\n# Conversation History\n- You: How do I use continuity at the boundary points to create equations for a and b? Which function values should I compare at x = 2 and x = -2?\n- AI Tutor: Good — you're on the right track by thinking about the boundary points where the formula changes. Continuity at a boundary means the left-hand and right-hand limits (which for piecewise-defined simple formulas are just the function values from the appropriate pieces) agree there and equal the value of the function at that point.\n\nIdentify the two boundary points: x = 2 and x = −2.\n\n1. At x = 2:\n- For x > 2 the expression used is ax + 3, so the right-hand value at 2 is a·2 + 3 = 2a + 3.\n- For −2 ≤ x ≤ 2 the expression used at x = 2 is x − 5, so the value there is 2 − 5 = −3.\nContinuity at x = 2 requires the right-hand value equal the value at 2. Write that equation.\n\n2. At x = −2:\n- For −2 ≤ x ≤ 2 the expression at x = −2 is x − 5, so the value there is −2 − 5 = −7.\n- For x < −2 the expression used is 2x − b, so the left-hand value at −2 is 2(−2) − b = −4 − b.\nContinuity at x = −2 requires the left-hand value equal the value at −2. Write that equation.\n\nNow you have two equations in a and b. What are those equations? Solve them for a and b, then compute a + b. If you want, tell me the equations you wrote and your steps to solve them and I’ll check your work.\n- You: Okay — the equations I get are 2a + 3 = −3 (from x = 2) and −4 − b = −7 (from x = −2). Can you confirm those are set up correctly? Also, could you show the algebra to solve each for a and b and then compute a + b?\n- AI Tutor: You're correct about the two equations — those come from setting the appropriate piecewise expressions equal at the boundary points. Now try solving each equation step by step; I'll guide you and check your work.\n\nStart with 2a + 3 = −3. Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the 2a term: what do you get next? \n\nThen move to −4 − b = −7. Add 4 to both sides to isolate −b: what does that give you, and what is b after you multiply or change sign?\n\nAfter you find a and b, add them to get a + b. Tell me the values you obtain and I'll confirm.\n- You: After solving, a = −3 and b = 3, so a + b = 0.\n- AI Tutor: Exactly right. Quick check of your steps:\n\n- From 2a + 3 = −3: subtract 3 to get 2a = −6, so a = −3.\n- From −4 − b = −7: add 4 to get −b = −3, so b = 3.\n- Then a + b = −3 + 3 = 0.\n\nEverything is correct. Nicely done.\n- You: Thanks — that explanation helped. One quick question: when deciding which piece to use for the left- or right-hand value at a boundary, is the rule always \"use the piece valid for x just less than the boundary for the left-hand limit, and the piece valid for x just greater than the boundary for the right-hand limit\"? Just want to be sure I apply that correctly on future piecewise problems.\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that rule is exactly right and is the general way to handle piecewise functions at boundary points.\n\nMore precisely:\n- The left-hand limit at a point x = c uses the formula that applies for x values slightly less than c (the piece covering values just to the left of c).\n- The right-hand limit at x = c uses the formula that applies for x values slightly greater than c (the piece covering values just to the right of c).\n- If the function is defined at c, its actual value f(c) may come from one of the pieces (depending on how the piecewise definition specifies the intervals). For continuity you need left-hand limit = right-hand limit = f(c).\n\nA couple of quick reminders:\n- Pay attention to whether the interval endpoints in the piecewise definition are included (≤ or ≥) or excluded (< or >). That tells you which piece gives f(c) itself.\n- Even if f(c) is defined by only one piece, both one-sided limits must still match that value for continuity.\n- If one-sided limits differ, the function has a jump discontinuity at c.\n\nIf you want, I can give a short example with different endpoint inclusions so you can practice identifying which piece to use for left, right, and f(c). Which would you prefer?\n- You: Thanks — that makes sense and I see how to pick the pieces for left and right limits now. Quick follow-up: if the piecewise definition uses strict inequalities on both sides (so f(c) isn't defined by either piece), we still just compare the left- and right-hand expressions — do we then say the function is discontinuous at c unless those two one-sided limits happen to be equal? Is that the right way to state it?\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that's exactly right. If f(c) is not defined (because neither piece includes x = c), then for continuity at c you'd need both one-sided limits to exist and be equal; only then could you extend f to be continuous there by defining f(c) equal to that common value. If the left- and right-hand limits are different (or one/both fail to exist), the function has a discontinuity at c and you cannot make it continuous at c without changing the function.\n\nMore compactly:\n- If f(c) is defined: continuity at c requires left-hand limit = right-hand limit = f(c).\n- If f(c) is not defined: continuity at c would require left-hand limit = right-hand limit (and then you could define f(c) to be that common value to make it continuous). If the one-sided limits differ, the point is a jump discontinuity.\n\nGood thinking — do you want an example where f(c) isn't defined so you can practice deciding whether the limits match?\n- You: Thanks — that cleared it up. One quick thing I'd like to confirm: when checking continuity at a boundary I should first note which inequalities include the endpoint (≤ or ≥) to identify f(c) if it’s defined, then independently pick the piece for x<c for the left-hand limit and the piece for x>c for the right-hand limit, and finally compare left, right, and f(c) (if present). Is that the complete checklist I should use every time?\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that checklist is complete and a reliable procedure to follow every time. In summary, when checking continuity at a boundary point c:\n\n1. Check whether f(c) is defined by looking at the interval endpoints (≤ / ≥ vs < / >). If included, determine f(c) from the piece that contains c.\n2. For the left-hand limit, use the formula that applies for x values just less than c (the piece covering x < c near c).\n3. For the right-hand limit, use the formula that applies for x values just greater than c (the piece covering x > c near c).\n4. Compare:\n   - If f(c) is defined: require left-hand limit = right-hand limit = f(c).\n   - If f(c) is not defined: require left-hand limit = right-hand limit in order for the function to be extendable to a continuous function at c; otherwise it's discontinuous.\n\nExtra tips:\n- Watch endpoint inclusions carefully — they determine which piece gives f(c).\n- You can compute the one-sided limits by directly substituting c into the corresponding formulas when those formulas are polynomials/linear (or otherwise continuous on their intervals).\n- If either one-sided limit does not exist, the function is discontinuous at c.\n\nWould you like a quick example to practice this checklist?\n- You: Thanks — that checklist makes sense and I see how to apply it. One question: if the boundary point is also the domain endpoint (so only one side of x exists in the domain), do I treat the absent side as \"not applicable\" or do I still require the existing one-sided limit to equal f(c) for continuity at that endpoint?\n- AI Tutor: Good question — endpoints of the domain are a special but simple case.\n\nIf c is an endpoint of the domain (so values only exist on one side of c), you treat the missing one-sided limit as not applicable. Continuity at c then requires that the one existing one-sided limit equals f(c).\n\nMore concretely:\n- If the domain includes values only for x ≥ c (left endpoint), check the right-hand limit lim_{x→c+} f(x). If f(c) is defined, continuity at c means lim_{x→c+} f(x) = f(c). (The left-hand limit lim_{x→c-} is not applicable.)\n- If the domain includes values only for x ≤ c (right endpoint), check the left-hand limit lim_{x→c-} f(x). Continuity at c means lim_{x→c-} f(x) = f(c). (The right-hand limit is not applicable.)\n\nIn short: at a domain endpoint you only require the one relevant one-sided limit to match f(c). If f(c) is not defined, you cannot have continuity at that endpoint (unless you extend the function by defining f(c) equal to the existing one-sided limit). \n\nWould you like a quick example of checking continuity at a domain endpoint?\n- You: Thanks — that clarification helped. I see that at a domain endpoint I only need the existing one-sided limit to match f(c). One quick follow-up: if the endpoint is included in a piecewise definition but the formula there is something like a fraction that becomes undefined at c (so f(c) isn't actually defined even though the inequality includes c), do we treat that the same as \"f(c) not defined\" and therefore say it's discontinuous unless the one-sided limit exists and we redefine f(c)? In other words, inclusion by the interval doesn't override the function being undefined at that point — right?\n- AI Tutor: Right — inclusion by the interval does not override the actual formula failing to produce a value at that point. If the piece that \"contains\" c has a formula that is undefined at c (like a division by zero, a logarithm of a nonpositive number, etc.), then f(c) is not defined in practice, even if the interval symbol includes c. You should treat that the same as any other point where f(c) is not defined.\n\nSo you proceed this way:\n- First check whether the formula for the piece that supposedly defines f(c) actually yields a finite value at c. If it does, that is f(c).\n- If the formula is undefined at c, then f(c) is not defined (unless the problem explicitly states some defined value at c).\n- For continuity:\n  - If f(c) is defined, require the relevant one-sided limits equal f(c) (or both one-sided limits equal f(c) if c is an interior point).\n  - If f(c) is not defined, continuity at c would require the one-sided limits (the ones that make sense given the domain) to exist and be equal; then you could define f(c) to be that common limit to make the function continuous there. If the one-sided limits do not agree (or don't exist), the point is a discontinuity.\n\nExample to keep in mind: Suppose a piece is defined as (x^2 − 1)/(x − 1) for x ≤ 1. The algebraic expression is undefined at x = 1, even though the interval includes 1. You should note f(1) is not defined unless the definition separately specifies a value at 1. However, the one-sided limit (from the left) of that expression as x → 1− equals 2 (because the fraction simplifies to x+1 for x ≠ 1). So you could say the left-hand limit exists and equals 2, but f(1) is undefined — the function is not continuous at 1 unless you define f(1) = 2.\n\nWould you like to try a short example where the formula is undefined at the endpoint so you can apply these steps?\n- You: Thanks — that clarification really helped. One quick question: when a formula is undefined at c but the one-sided limits both exist and are equal (a removable discontinuity), is it correct that we say the original function is discontinuous at c but can be made continuous by defining f(c) equal to that common limit? And in practice, when solving for unknown constants to enforce continuity across a boundary, I can treat f(c) as “not defined” initially and instead set the left- and right-hand expressions equal to each other (ignoring f(c)) to get the equation. Is that the right procedure every time in removable-discontinuity cases?\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that's all correct. A few precise points to keep your understanding exact:\n\n- If the formula at c is undefined (so f(c) is not actually a value), then the function as written is discontinuous at c, even if both one-sided limits exist and are equal. That kind of discontinuity is called removable because you can \"remove\" it by defining f(c) to be the common limit.\n\n- In solving for unknown constants to enforce continuity at a boundary where the function currently has no defined value at c, the right procedure is exactly what you described: require the left-hand limit and right-hand limit to be equal. Concretely, pick the piece valid for x < c, evaluate its formula as x → c− (usually by direct substitution if it's a polynomial/rational expression that's defined at c), pick the piece valid for x > c and evaluate as x → c+, and set those two expressions equal. Solve for the unknown(s). After that, defining f(c) to be that common value yields a continuous function at c.\n\n- If f(c) is defined but the formula gives an indeterminate/undefined expression at c, treat f(c) as not defined (unless the problem explicitly gives a value) and follow the same approach above.\n\n- Small caution: when dealing with rational expressions that simplify to a continuous expression except at c, you can often simplify first (noting equivalence for x ≠ c) and then substitute the limit value; but remember that simplification doesn't retroactively define f(c). You still must check and (if required) specify f(c).\n\nWould you like to practice this with a short example where you solve for a constant that removes a discontinuity?\n- You: Thanks — that cleared up my confusion about inclusion vs. actual definability at c. One more quick thing: when the left- and right-hand expressions are algebraically different but both simplify to the same value at c (for example one side simplifies after canceling a factor that’s zero at c), is it always safe to directly substitute c into each simplified form when forming the equation for continuity? Or should I keep the original unsimplified expressions and only simplify after equating them? Which is the more reliable step to avoid mistakes when solving for unknown constants?\n- AI Tutor: Good question — being careful here avoids mistakes. Short answer: either approach can work, but you must keep track of where algebraic simplifications are valid. Here's a reliable procedure and the reason behind it:\n\n1. Identify which piece applies on each side of c (x < c and x > c). For each piece, consider the expression as defining the function for values not equal to c (i.e., in a neighborhood excluding c if necessary).\n\n2. For computing the one-sided limits, you may simplify each piece first (cancel factors, factor polynomials, etc.) as long as you remember that simplification is only valid for x values where the canceled factor is not zero. That is fine because one-sided limits look at x approaching c but not equaling c, so simplifications that are valid for x ≠ c are allowed when evaluating the limit.\n\n   - Example: if a piece is (x^2 − 1)/(x − 1) for x < 1, you can simplify to x + 1 for x ≠ 1 and then substitute x = 1 to get the left-hand limit 2.\n\n3. If you are forming algebraic equations to enforce continuity (i.e., setting left-hand limit = right-hand limit), it is safe and often simpler to simplify each expression first (valid for x ≠ c) and then substitute c to get the limit values to equate. This is the usual, reliable method when the simplifications do not depend on unknowns making denominators zero at c.\n\n4. Caution cases to watch for:\n   - If simplifying introduces division by an expression that might be zero for some values of the unknown constants, you must check those parameter values separately. For example, if simplification cancels a factor that contains the unknown constant, the cancellation might be invalid for certain constant values; always ensure the canceled factor is nonzero given the unknowns' values, or handle the special cases separately.\n   - If the original piece's formula truly fails to be defined at c (division by zero etc.), remember f(c) is still undefined unless explicitly given — simplification does not define f(c), it only gives the limit.\n\n5. Practical rule of thumb:\n   - Simplify each side (for x ≠ c), compute the one-sided limits by substituting c into the simplified forms, set those limits equal, and solve for unknowns.\n   - After solving, verify that your solution doesn't make any denominator (or other restricted expression) zero in the original formulas at values of x near c (which could invalidate the simplification step). If it does, handle that special case separately.\n\nWould you like to try a quick example where simplification cancels a factor so you can practice both the usual method and checking special cases?\n- You: Thanks — that explanation helped me learn the nuance about cancellations depending on unknown constants. One quick confirmation: after I solve the equations produced by equating the one-sided limits (using simplified forms), the final extra check should be to substitute the found parameter values back into the original piecewise formulas and verify no denominator (or other undefined expression) is zero for x near the boundary — is that the complete post-solution check, or should I also explicitly test the original unsimplified expressions at the boundary point itself?\n- AI Tutor: Good attention to detail — that's exactly the right idea, and you're mostly done with the checks. Here's a concise checklist of what to do after you solve for the parameters; follow these to be thorough and avoid subtle mistakes:\n\n1. Substitute the found parameter values into the original piecewise formulas.\n2. Check the one-sided limits near the boundary by substituting the boundary value into the simplified forms (these give the limits because simplification is valid for x ≠ c). Confirm they are equal (this should hold because you solved for that).\n3. Check the original (unsimplified) formulas for any expressions that are undefined at or near c:\n   - Verify no denominator becomes zero for x values arbitrarily close to c on the side where that piece is used.\n   - Verify there are no other domain issues (like logs of nonpositive numbers, square roots of negatives, etc.) for x near c.\n4. Check whether f(c) is actually defined in the piecewise definition:\n   - If the interval inclusion gives f(c) (≤ or ≥) and the substituted formula is defined at c, compute f(c) and verify it equals the common one-sided limit.\n   - If the piece's formula is undefined at c (even if the interval includes c), then f(c) is not defined; in that case the original function is still discontinuous at c until you explicitly define f(c) equal to the common limit. Note this does not contradict solving for parameters to make the limits equal — it only means you must define f(c) afterward to make the function continuous as written.\n5. If any parameter value you found makes a denominator zero (or otherwise causes the expression to be undefined) at x values arbitrarily close to c for the relevant side, you must treat that as a special case. Either:\n   - reject that parameter value if it prevents the required limit from existing, or\n   - analyze it separately to see whether the limit still exists (often it won't).\n\nIn short: yes — substitute parameter values back into the original formulas and check for undefined behavior near the boundary; additionally, explicitly check f(c) (if the interval includes c) to ensure it matches the one-sided limits. Those steps together constitute the complete post-solution check.\n- You: Thanks — that checklist cleared up my last uncertainty. I understand now to (1) simplify to compute one-sided limits, (2) set them equal to solve for parameters, and then (3) substitute those parameter values back into the original unsimplified pieces to check for any domain issues and to confirm whether f(c) is actually defined and equals the common limit. One quick confirmation: if after substituting the parameters the original piece that supposedly defines f(c) is undefined at c, then I should report the function as discontinuous at c unless the problem explicitly tells me to redefine f(c). Is that the correct final takeaway?\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that's the correct final takeaway.\n\nTo restate succinctly:\n- If the piecewise definition (after substituting solved parameters) gives a concrete finite value at c (the formula is defined there and the interval includes c), then continuity at c requires that value to equal the common one-sided limit.\n- If the piecewise definition does not actually produce a value at c (the formula is undefined at c, even if the interval symbol includes c), then as written the function is discontinuous at c. It can be made continuous only by explicitly defining f(c) to be the common one-sided limit (if that common limit exists).\n- If the one-sided limits themselves do not agree, the function has a nonremovable (jump) discontinuity at c and cannot be made continuous there by merely defining f(c).\n\nYou've got the right procedure and conclusion — well done.\n- You: Thanks — that all clarified things for me. One thing I'd like to confirm about the post-solution checks: after I solve for parameters by equating one-sided limits and substitute them back, is it enough to check (a) the simplified limit values match, (b) no denominators or other domain problems occur for x near the boundary on the relevant sides, and (c) whether the piece that “includes” the endpoint actually evaluates to a finite number at the endpoint? Or should I also explicitly check the original unsimplified formula exactly at the endpoint even when the interval notation includes it (i.e., is checking (c) the same as checking the original formula at the endpoint)? I want to be sure I'm not skipping any distinct check.\n- AI Tutor: You're asking for a precise checklist so you don't accidentally skip a distinct step — good thinking. Your three checks (a), (b), and (c) are essentially the correct and complete set, and checking (c) is exactly the same as evaluating the original (unsimplified) formula at the endpoint to see whether it yields a finite value. I'll restate them and point out why each is needed and how they differ (or not):\n\n1. Check the one-sided limits (usually using the simplified forms).\n   - This is (a). Simplifying is fine because limits look at x approaching c, not x = c, so canceling factors that are zero only at c is allowed.\n   - Purpose: ensures the left- and right-hand behavior match (or gives the common limit).\n\n2. Check for domain issues near the boundary on each relevant side.\n   - This is (b).

Which function values should I compare at x = 2 and x = -2?\n- AI Tutor: Good — you're on the right track by thinking about the boundary points where the formula changes. Continuity at a boundary means the left-hand and right-hand limits (which for piecewise-defined simple formulas are just the function values from the appropriate pieces) agree there and equal the value of the function at that point.\n\nIdentify the two boundary points: x = 2 and x = −2.\n\n1. At x = 2:\n- For x > 2 the expression used is ax + 3, so the right-hand value at 2 is a·2 + 3 = 2a + 3.\n- For −2 ≤ x ≤ 2 the expression used at x = 2 is x − 5, so the value there is 2 − 5 = −3.\nContinuity at x = 2 requires the right-hand value equal the value at 2. Write that equation.\n\n2. At x = −2:\n- For −2 ≤ x ≤ 2 the expression at x = −2 is x − 5, so the value there is −2 − 5 = −7.\n- For x < −2 the expression used is 2x − b, so the left-hand value at −2 is 2(−2) − b = −4 − b.\nContinuity at x = −2 requires the left-hand value equal the value at −2. Write that equation.\n\nNow you have two equations in a and b. What are those equations? Solve them for a and b, then compute a + b. If you want, tell me the equations you wrote and your steps to solve them and I’ll check your work.\n- You: Okay — the equations I get are 2a + 3 = −3 (from x = 2) and −4 − b = −7 (from x = −2). Can you confirm those are set up correctly? Also, could you show the algebra to solve each for a and b and then compute a + b?\n- AI Tutor: You're correct about the two equations — those come from setting the appropriate piecewise expressions equal at the boundary points. Now try solving each equation step by step; I'll guide you and check your work.\n\nStart with 2a + 3 = −3. Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the 2a term: what do you get next? \n\nThen move to −4 − b = −7. Add 4 to both sides to isolate −b: what does that give you, and what is b after you multiply or change sign?\n\nAfter you find a and b, add them to get a + b. Tell me the values you obtain and I'll confirm.\n- You: After solving, a = −3 and b = 3, so a + b = 0.\n- AI Tutor: Exactly right. Quick check of your steps:\n\n- From 2a + 3 = −3: subtract 3 to get 2a = −6, so a = −3.\n- From −4 − b = −7: add 4 to get −b = −3, so b = 3.\n- Then a + b = −3 + 3 = 0.\n\nEverything is correct. Nicely done.\n- You: Thanks — that explanation helped. One quick question: when deciding which piece to use for the left- or right-hand value at a boundary, is the rule always \"use the piece valid for x just less than the boundary for the left-hand limit, and the piece valid for x just greater than the boundary for the right-hand limit\"? Just want to be sure I apply that correctly on future piecewise problems.\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that rule is exactly right and is the general way to handle piecewise functions at boundary points.\n\nMore precisely:\n- The left-hand limit at a point x = c uses the formula that applies for x values slightly less than c (the piece covering values just to the left of c).\n- The right-hand limit at x = c uses the formula that applies for x values slightly greater than c (the piece covering values just to the right of c).\n- If the function is defined at c, its actual value f(c) may come from one of the pieces (depending on how the piecewise definition specifies the intervals). For continuity you need left-hand limit = right-hand limit = f(c).\n\nA couple of quick reminders:\n- Pay attention to whether the interval endpoints in the piecewise definition are included (≤ or ≥) or excluded (< or >). That tells you which piece gives f(c) itself.\n- Even if f(c) is defined by only one piece, both one-sided limits must still match that value for continuity.\n- If one-sided limits differ, the function has a jump discontinuity at c.\n\nIf you want, I can give a short example with different endpoint inclusions so you can practice identifying which piece to use for left, right, and f(c). Which would you prefer?\n- You: Thanks — that makes sense and I see how to pick the pieces for left and right limits now. Quick follow-up: if the piecewise definition uses strict inequalities on both sides (so f(c) isn't defined by either piece), we still just compare the left- and right-hand expressions — do we then say the function is discontinuous at c unless those two one-sided limits happen to be equal? Is that the right way to state it?\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that's exactly right. If f(c) is not defined (because neither piece includes x = c), then for continuity at c you'd need both one-sided limits to exist and be equal; only then could you extend f to be continuous there by defining f(c) equal to that common value. If the left- and right-hand limits are different (or one/both fail to exist), the function has a discontinuity at c and you cannot make it continuous at c without changing the function.\n\nMore compactly:\n- If f(c) is defined: continuity at c requires left-hand limit = right-hand limit = f(c).\n- If f(c) is not defined: continuity at c would require left-hand limit = right-hand limit (and then you could define f(c) to be that common value to make it continuous). If the one-sided limits differ, the point is a jump discontinuity.\n\nGood thinking — do you want an example where f(c) isn't defined so you can practice deciding whether the limits match?\n- You: Thanks — that cleared it up. One quick thing I'd like to confirm: when checking continuity at a boundary I should first note which inequalities include the endpoint (≤ or ≥) to identify f(c) if it’s defined, then independently pick the piece for x<c for the left-hand limit and the piece for x>c for the right-hand limit, and finally compare left, right, and f(c) (if present). Is that the complete checklist I should use every time?\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that checklist is complete and a reliable procedure to follow every time. In summary, when checking continuity at a boundary point c:\n\n1. Check whether f(c) is defined by looking at the interval endpoints (≤ / ≥ vs < / >). If included, determine f(c) from the piece that contains c.\n2. For the left-hand limit, use the formula that applies for x values just less than c (the piece covering x < c near c).\n3. For the right-hand limit, use the formula that applies for x values just greater than c (the piece covering x > c near c).\n4. Compare:\n   - If f(c) is defined: require left-hand limit = right-hand limit = f(c).\n   - If f(c) is not defined: require left-hand limit = right-hand limit in order for the function to be extendable to a continuous function at c; otherwise it's discontinuous.\n\nExtra tips:\n- Watch endpoint inclusions carefully — they determine which piece gives f(c).\n- You can compute the one-sided limits by directly substituting c into the corresponding formulas when those formulas are polynomials/linear (or otherwise continuous on their intervals).\n- If either one-sided limit does not exist, the function is discontinuous at c.\n\nWould you like a quick example to practice this checklist?\n- You: Thanks — that checklist makes sense and I see how to apply it. One question: if the boundary point is also the domain endpoint (so only one side of x exists in the domain), do I treat the absent side as \"not applicable\" or do I still require the existing one-sided limit to equal f(c) for continuity at that endpoint?\n- AI Tutor: Good question — endpoints of the domain are a special but simple case.\n\nIf c is an endpoint of the domain (so values only exist on one side of c), you treat the missing one-sided limit as not applicable. Continuity at c then requires that the one existing one-sided limit equals f(c).\n\nMore concretely:\n- If the domain includes values only for x ≥ c (left endpoint), check the right-hand limit lim_{x→c+} f(x). If f(c) is defined, continuity at c means lim_{x→c+} f(x) = f(c). (The left-hand limit lim_{x→c-} is not applicable.)\n- If the domain includes values only for x ≤ c (right endpoint), check the left-hand limit lim_{x→c-} f(x). Continuity at c means lim_{x→c-} f(x) = f(c). (The right-hand limit is not applicable.)\n\nIn short: at a domain endpoint you only require the one relevant one-sided limit to match f(c). If f(c) is not defined, you cannot have continuity at that endpoint (unless you extend the function by defining f(c) equal to the existing one-sided limit). \n\nWould you like a quick example of checking continuity at a domain endpoint?\n- You: Thanks — that clarification helped. I see that at a domain endpoint I only need the existing one-sided limit to match f(c). One quick follow-up: if the endpoint is included in a piecewise definition but the formula there is something like a fraction that becomes undefined at c (so f(c) isn't actually defined even though the inequality includes c), do we treat that the same as \"f(c) not defined\" and therefore say it's discontinuous unless the one-sided limit exists and we redefine f(c)? In other words, inclusion by the interval doesn't override the function being undefined at that point — right?\n- AI Tutor: Right — inclusion by the interval does not override the actual formula failing to produce a value at that point. If the piece that \"contains\" c has a formula that is undefined at c (like a division by zero, a logarithm of a nonpositive number, etc.), then f(c) is not defined in practice, even if the interval symbol includes c. You should treat that the same as any other point where f(c) is not defined.\n\nSo you proceed this way:\n- First check whether the formula for the piece that supposedly defines f(c) actually yields a finite value at c. If it does, that is f(c).\n- If the formula is undefined at c, then f(c) is not defined (unless the problem explicitly states some defined value at c).\n- For continuity:\n  - If f(c) is defined, require the relevant one-sided limits equal f(c) (or both one-sided limits equal f(c) if c is an interior point).\n  - If f(c) is not defined, continuity at c would require the one-sided limits (the ones that make sense given the domain) to exist and be equal; then you could define f(c) to be that common limit to make the function continuous there. If the one-sided limits do not agree (or don't exist), the point is a discontinuity.\n\nExample to keep in mind: Suppose a piece is defined as (x^2 − 1)/(x − 1) for x ≤ 1. The algebraic expression is undefined at x = 1, even though the interval includes 1. You should note f(1) is not defined unless the definition separately specifies a value at 1. However, the one-sided limit (from the left) of that expression as x → 1− equals 2 (because the fraction simplifies to x+1 for x ≠ 1). So you could say the left-hand limit exists and equals 2, but f(1) is undefined — the function is not continuous at 1 unless you define f(1) = 2.\n\nWould you like to try a short example where the formula is undefined at the endpoint so you can apply these steps?\n- You: Thanks — that clarification really helped. One quick question: when a formula is undefined at c but the one-sided limits both exist and are equal (a removable discontinuity), is it correct that we say the original function is discontinuous at c but can be made continuous by defining f(c) equal to that common limit? And in practice, when solving for unknown constants to enforce continuity across a boundary, I can treat f(c) as “not defined” initially and instead set the left- and right-hand expressions equal to each other (ignoring f(c)) to get the equation. Is that the right procedure every time in removable-discontinuity cases?\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that's all correct. A few precise points to keep your understanding exact:\n\n- If the formula at c is undefined (so f(c) is not actually a value), then the function as written is discontinuous at c, even if both one-sided limits exist and are equal. That kind of discontinuity is called removable because you can \"remove\" it by defining f(c) to be the common limit.\n\n- In solving for unknown constants to enforce continuity at a boundary where the function currently has no defined value at c, the right procedure is exactly what you described: require the left-hand limit and right-hand limit to be equal. Concretely, pick the piece valid for x < c, evaluate its formula as x → c− (usually by direct substitution if it's a polynomial/rational expression that's defined at c), pick the piece valid for x > c and evaluate as x → c+, and set those two expressions equal. Solve for the unknown(s). After that, defining f(c) to be that common value yields a continuous function at c.\n\n- If f(c) is defined but the formula gives an indeterminate/undefined expression at c, treat f(c) as not defined (unless the problem explicitly gives a value) and follow the same approach above.\n\n- Small caution: when dealing with rational expressions that simplify to a continuous expression except at c, you can often simplify first (noting equivalence for x ≠ c) and then substitute the limit value; but remember that simplification doesn't retroactively define f(c). You still must check and (if required) specify f(c).\n\nWould you like to practice this with a short example where you solve for a constant that removes a discontinuity?\n- You: Thanks — that cleared up my confusion about inclusion vs. actual definability at c. One more quick thing: when the left- and right-hand expressions are algebraically different but both simplify to the same value at c (for example one side simplifies after canceling a factor that’s zero at c), is it always safe to directly substitute c into each simplified form when forming the equation for continuity? Or should I keep the original unsimplified expressions and only simplify after equating them? Which is the more reliable step to avoid mistakes when solving for unknown constants?\n- AI Tutor: Good question — being careful here avoids mistakes. Short answer: either approach can work, but you must keep track of where algebraic simplifications are valid. Here's a reliable procedure and the reason behind it:\n\n1. Identify which piece applies on each side of c (x < c and x > c). For each piece, consider the expression as defining the function for values not equal to c (i.e., in a neighborhood excluding c if necessary).\n\n2. For computing the one-sided limits, you may simplify each piece first (cancel factors, factor polynomials, etc.) as long as you remember that simplification is only valid for x values where the canceled factor is not zero. That is fine because one-sided limits look at x approaching c but not equaling c, so simplifications that are valid for x ≠ c are allowed when evaluating the limit.\n\n   - Example: if a piece is (x^2 − 1)/(x − 1) for x < 1, you can simplify to x + 1 for x ≠ 1 and then substitute x = 1 to get the left-hand limit 2.\n\n3. If you are forming algebraic equations to enforce continuity (i.e., setting left-hand limit = right-hand limit), it is safe and often simpler to simplify each expression first (valid for x ≠ c) and then substitute c to get the limit values to equate. This is the usual, reliable method when the simplifications do not depend on unknowns making denominators zero at c.\n\n4. Caution cases to watch for:\n   - If simplifying introduces division by an expression that might be zero for some values of the unknown constants, you must check those parameter values separately. For example, if simplification cancels a factor that contains the unknown constant, the cancellation might be invalid for certain constant values; always ensure the canceled factor is nonzero given the unknowns' values, or handle the special cases separately.\n   - If the original piece's formula truly fails to be defined at c (division by zero etc.), remember f(c) is still undefined unless explicitly given — simplification does not define f(c), it only gives the limit.\n\n5. Practical rule of thumb:\n   - Simplify each side (for x ≠ c), compute the one-sided limits by substituting c into the simplified forms, set those limits equal, and solve for unknowns.\n   - After solving, verify that your solution doesn't make any denominator (or other restricted expression) zero in the original formulas at values of x near c (which could invalidate the simplification step). If it does, handle that special case separately.\n\nWould you like to try a quick example where simplification cancels a factor so you can practice both the usual method and checking special cases?\n- You: Thanks — that explanation helped me learn the nuance about cancellations depending on unknown constants. One quick confirmation: after I solve the equations produced by equating the one-sided limits (using simplified forms), the final extra check should be to substitute the found parameter values back into the original piecewise formulas and verify no denominator (or other undefined expression) is zero for x near the boundary — is that the complete post-solution check, or should I also explicitly test the original unsimplified expressions at the boundary point itself?\n- AI Tutor: Good attention to detail — that's exactly the right idea, and you're mostly done with the checks. Here's a concise checklist of what to do after you solve for the parameters; follow these to be thorough and avoid subtle mistakes:\n\n1. Substitute the found parameter values into the original piecewise formulas.\n2. Check the one-sided limits near the boundary by substituting the boundary value into the simplified forms (these give the limits because simplification is valid for x ≠ c). Confirm they are equal (this should hold because you solved for that).\n3. Check the original (unsimplified) formulas for any expressions that are undefined at or near c:\n   - Verify no denominator becomes zero for x values arbitrarily close to c on the side where that piece is used.\n   - Verify there are no other domain issues (like logs of nonpositive numbers, square roots of negatives, etc.) for x near c.\n4. Check whether f(c) is actually defined in the piecewise definition:\n   - If the interval inclusion gives f(c) (≤ or ≥) and the substituted formula is defined at c, compute f(c) and verify it equals the common one-sided limit.\n   - If the piece's formula is undefined at c (even if the interval includes c), then f(c) is not defined; in that case the original function is still discontinuous at c until you explicitly define f(c) equal to the common limit. Note this does not contradict solving for parameters to make the limits equal — it only means you must define f(c) afterward to make the function continuous as written.\n5. If any parameter value you found makes a denominator zero (or otherwise causes the expression to be undefined) at x values arbitrarily close to c for the relevant side, you must treat that as a special case. Either:\n   - reject that parameter value if it prevents the required limit from existing, or\n   - analyze it separately to see whether the limit still exists (often it won't).\n\nIn short: yes — substitute parameter values back into the original formulas and check for undefined behavior near the boundary; additionally, explicitly check f(c) (if the interval includes c) to ensure it matches the one-sided limits. Those steps together constitute the complete post-solution check.\n- You: Thanks — that checklist cleared up my last uncertainty. I understand now to (1) simplify to compute one-sided limits, (2) set them equal to solve for parameters, and then (3) substitute those parameter values back into the original unsimplified pieces to check for any domain issues and to confirm whether f(c) is actually defined and equals the common limit. One quick confirmation: if after substituting the parameters the original piece that supposedly defines f(c) is undefined at c, then I should report the function as discontinuous at c unless the problem explicitly tells me to redefine f(c). Is that the correct final takeaway?\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that's the correct final takeaway.\n\nTo restate succinctly:\n- If the piecewise definition (after substituting solved parameters) gives a concrete finite value at c (the formula is defined there and the interval includes c), then continuity at c requires that value to equal the common one-sided limit.\n- If the piecewise definition does not actually produce a value at c (the formula is undefined at c, even if the interval symbol includes c), then as written the function is discontinuous at c. It can be made continuous only by explicitly defining f(c) to be the common one-sided limit (if that common limit exists).\n- If the one-sided limits themselves do not agree, the function has a nonremovable (jump) discontinuity at c and cannot be made continuous there by merely defining f(c).\n\nYou've got the right procedure and conclusion — well done.\n- You: Thanks — that all clarified things for me. One thing I'd like to confirm about the post-solution checks: after I solve for parameters by equating one-sided limits and substitute them back, is it enough to check (a) the simplified limit values match, (b) no denominators or other domain problems occur for x near the boundary on the relevant sides, and (c) whether the piece that “includes” the endpoint actually evaluates to a finite number at the endpoint? Or should I also explicitly check the original unsimplified formula exactly at the endpoint even when the interval notation includes it (i.e., is checking (c) the same as checking the original formula at the endpoint)? I want to be sure I'm not skipping any distinct check.\n- AI Tutor: You're asking for a precise checklist so you don't accidentally skip a distinct step — good thinking. Your three checks (a), (b), and (c) are essentially the correct and complete set, and checking (c) is exactly the same as evaluating the original (unsimplified) formula at the endpoint to see whether it yields a finite value. I'll restate them and point out why each is needed and how they differ (or not):\n\n1. Check the one-sided limits (usually using the simplified forms).\n   - This is (a). Simplifying is fine because limits look at x approaching c, not x = c, so canceling factors that are zero only at c is allowed.\n   - Purpose: ensures the left- and right-hand behavior match (or gives the common limit).\n\n2. Check for domain issues near the boundary on each relevant side.\n   - This is (b). After substituting the parameter values back into the original piecewise formulas, verify that for x values arbitrarily close to c (but on the correct side), the expression is defined (no zero denominators, no negative inside an even root, etc.).\n   - Purpose: ensures the limit you computed actually exists in the original formula (and that your simplification didn't hide a problem like division by an expression that could be zero for nearby x when parameters take certain values).\n\n3. Check whether the piece that is supposed to define f(c) actually produces a finite value at c.\n   - This is (c), and it is identical to evaluating the original (unsimplified) formula at x = c (provided the interval notation includes the endpoint). If the formula is undefined at c, then f(c) is not defined in the given function even if the notation suggests it is; you must report the function as discontinuous at c unless the problem allows redefining f(c).\n   - Purpose: ensures the function as written has an assigned value at c, and that that value equals the common one-sided limit (for actual continuity).\n\nSo no, you do not need an additional separate check beyond these three. In particular, \"checking (c)\" is the same thing as \"explicitly checking the original unsimplified formula exactly at the endpoint\" — because whether the formula is defined at c can only be determined by evaluating that original formula at c (after substituting parameter values). The only extra subtlety to remember is: if your simplification canceled a factor that depends on the parameters, make sure that cancellation was valid for the parameter values you found; if not, analyze that special parameter case separately.\n\nIf you'd like, I can give a very short example that walks through (a)–(c) to illustrate the steps concretely.

Which would you prefer?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thanks — that makes sense and I see how to pick the pieces for left and right limits now. Quick follow-up: if the piecewise definition uses strict inequalities on both sides (so f(c) isn't defined by either piece), we still just compare the left- and right-hand expressions — do we then say the function is discontinuous at c unless those two one-sided limits happen to be equal? Is that the right way to state it?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes — that's exactly right. If f(c) is not defined (because neither piece includes x = c), then for continuity at c you'd need both one-sided limits to exist and be equal; only then could you extend f to be continuous there by defining f(c) equal to that common value. If the left- and right-hand limits are different (or one/both fail to exist), the function has a discontinuity at c and you cannot make it continuous at c without changing the function.\n\nMore compactly:\n- If f(c) is defined: continuity at c requires left-hand limit = right-hand limit = f(c).\n- If f(c) is not defined: continuity at c would require left-hand limit = right-hand limit (and then you could define f(c) to be that common value to make it continuous). If the one-sided limits differ, the point is a jump discontinuity.\n\nGood thinking — do you want an example where f(c) isn't defined so you can practice deciding whether the limits match?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thanks — that cleared it up. One quick thing I'd like to confirm: when checking continuity at a boundary I should first note which inequalities include the endpoint (≤ or ≥) to identify f(c) if it’s defined, then independently pick the piece for x<c for the left-hand limit and the piece for x>c for the right-hand limit, and finally compare left, right, and f(c) (if present). Is that the complete checklist I should use every time?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes — that checklist is complete and a reliable procedure to follow every time. In summary, when checking continuity at a boundary point c:\n\n1. Check whether f(c) is defined by looking at the interval endpoints (≤ / ≥ vs < / >). If included, determine f(c) from the piece that contains c.\n2. For the left-hand limit, use the formula that applies for x values just less than c (the piece covering x < c near c).\n3. For the right-hand limit, use the formula that applies for x values just greater than c (the piece covering x > c near c).\n4. Compare:\n   - If f(c) is defined: require left-hand limit = right-hand limit = f(c).\n   - If f(c) is not defined: require left-hand limit = right-hand limit in order for the function to be extendable to a continuous function at c; otherwise it's discontinuous.\n\nExtra tips:\n- Watch endpoint inclusions carefully — they determine which piece gives f(c).\n- You can compute the one-sided limits by directly substituting c into the corresponding formulas when those formulas are polynomials/linear (or otherwise continuous on their intervals).\n- If either one-sided limit does not exist, the function is discontinuous at c.\n\nWould you like a quick example to practice this checklist?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thanks — that checklist makes sense and I see how to apply it. One question: if the boundary point is also the domain endpoint (so only one side of x exists in the domain), do I treat the absent side as \"not applicable\" or do I still require the existing one-sided limit to equal f(c) for continuity at that endpoint?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Good question — endpoints of the domain are a special but simple case.\n\nIf c is an endpoint of the domain (so values only exist on one side of c), you treat the missing one-sided limit as not applicable. Continuity at c then requires that the one existing one-sided limit equals f(c).\n\nMore concretely:\n- If the domain includes values only for x ≥ c (left endpoint), check the right-hand limit lim_{x→c+} f(x). If f(c) is defined, continuity at c means lim_{x→c+} f(x) = f(c). (The left-hand limit lim_{x→c-} is not applicable.)\n- If the domain includes values only for x ≤ c (right endpoint), check the left-hand limit lim_{x→c-} f(x). Continuity at c means lim_{x→c-} f(x) = f(c). (The right-hand limit is not applicable.)\n\nIn short: at a domain endpoint you only require the one relevant one-sided limit to match f(c). If f(c) is not defined, you cannot have continuity at that endpoint (unless you extend the function by defining f(c) equal to the existing one-sided limit). \n\nWould you like a quick example of checking continuity at a domain endpoint?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thanks — that clarification helped. I see that at a domain endpoint I only need the existing one-sided limit to match f(c). One quick follow-up: if the endpoint is included in a piecewise definition but the formula there is something like a fraction that becomes undefined at c (so f(c) isn't actually defined even though the inequality includes c), do we treat that the same as \"f(c) not defined\" and therefore say it's discontinuous unless the one-sided limit exists and we redefine f(c)? In other words, inclusion by the interval doesn't override the function being undefined at that point — right?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Right — inclusion by the interval does not override the actual formula failing to produce a value at that point. If the piece that \"contains\" c has a formula that is undefined at c (like a division by zero, a logarithm of a nonpositive number, etc.), then f(c) is not defined in practice, even if the interval symbol includes c. You should treat that the same as any other point where f(c) is not defined.\n\nSo you proceed this way:\n- First check whether the formula for the piece that supposedly defines f(c) actually yields a finite value at c. If it does, that is f(c).\n- If the formula is undefined at c, then f(c) is not defined (unless the problem explicitly states some defined value at c).\n- For continuity:\n  - If f(c) is defined, require the relevant one-sided limits equal f(c) (or both one-sided limits equal f(c) if c is an interior point).\n  - If f(c) is not defined, continuity at c would require the one-sided limits (the ones that make sense given the domain) to exist and be equal; then you could define f(c) to be that common limit to make the function continuous there. If the one-sided limits do not agree (or don't exist), the point is a discontinuity.\n\nExample to keep in mind: Suppose a piece is defined as (x^2 − 1)/(x − 1) for x ≤ 1. The algebraic expression is undefined at x = 1, even though the interval includes 1. You should note f(1) is not defined unless the definition separately specifies a value at 1. However, the one-sided limit (from the left) of that expression as x → 1− equals 2 (because the fraction simplifies to x+1 for x ≠ 1). So you could say the left-hand limit exists and equals 2, but f(1) is undefined — the function is not continuous at 1 unless you define f(1) = 2.\n\nWould you like to try a short example where the formula is undefined at the endpoint so you can apply these steps?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thanks — that clarification really helped. One quick question: when a formula is undefined at c but the one-sided limits both exist and are equal (a removable discontinuity), is it correct that we say the original function is discontinuous at c but can be made continuous by defining f(c) equal to that common limit? And in practice, when solving for unknown constants to enforce continuity across a boundary, I can treat f(c) as “not defined” initially and instead set the left- and right-hand expressions equal to each other (ignoring f(c)) to get the equation. Is that the right procedure every time in removable-discontinuity cases?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes — that's all correct. A few precise points to keep your understanding exact:\n\n- If the formula at c is undefined (so f(c) is not actually a value), then the function as written is discontinuous at c, even if both one-sided limits exist and are equal. That kind of discontinuity is called removable because you can \"remove\" it by defining f(c) to be the common limit.\n\n- In solving for unknown constants to enforce continuity at a boundary where the function currently has no defined value at c, the right procedure is exactly what you described: require the left-hand limit and right-hand limit to be equal. Concretely, pick the piece valid for x < c, evaluate its formula as x → c− (usually by direct substitution if it's a polynomial/rational expression that's defined at c), pick the piece valid for x > c and evaluate as x → c+, and set those two expressions equal. Solve for the unknown(s). After that, defining f(c) to be that common value yields a continuous function at c.\n\n- If f(c) is defined but the formula gives an indeterminate/undefined expression at c, treat f(c) as not defined (unless the problem explicitly gives a value) and follow the same approach above.\n\n- Small caution: when dealing with rational expressions that simplify to a continuous expression except at c, you can often simplify first (noting equivalence for x ≠ c) and then substitute the limit value; but remember that simplification doesn't retroactively define f(c). You still must check and (if required) specify f(c).\n\nWould you like to practice this with a short example where you solve for a constant that removes a discontinuity?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thanks — that cleared up my confusion about inclusion vs. actual definability at c. One more quick thing: when the left- and right-hand expressions are algebraically different but both simplify to the same value at c (for example one side simplifies after canceling a factor that’s zero at c), is it always safe to directly substitute c into each simplified form when forming the equation for continuity? Or should I keep the original unsimplified expressions and only simplify after equating them? Which is the more reliable step to avoid mistakes when solving for unknown constants?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Good question — being careful here avoids mistakes. Short answer: either approach can work, but you must keep track of where algebraic simplifications are valid. Here's a reliable procedure and the reason behind it:\n\n1. Identify which piece applies on each side of c (x < c and x > c). For each piece, consider the expression as defining the function for values not equal to c (i.e., in a neighborhood excluding c if necessary).\n\n2. For computing the one-sided limits, you may simplify each piece first (cancel factors, factor polynomials, etc.) as long as you remember that simplification is only valid for x values where the canceled factor is not zero. That is fine because one-sided limits look at x approaching c but not equaling c, so simplifications that are valid for x ≠ c are allowed when evaluating the limit.\n\n   - Example: if a piece is (x^2 − 1)/(x − 1) for x < 1, you can simplify to x + 1 for x ≠ 1 and then substitute x = 1 to get the left-hand limit 2.\n\n3. If you are forming algebraic equations to enforce continuity (i.e., setting left-hand limit = right-hand limit), it is safe and often simpler to simplify each expression first (valid for x ≠ c) and then substitute c to get the limit values to equate. This is the usual, reliable method when the simplifications do not depend on unknowns making denominators zero at c.\n\n4. Caution cases to watch for:\n   - If simplifying introduces division by an expression that might be zero for some values of the unknown constants, you must check those parameter values separately. For example, if simplification cancels a factor that contains the unknown constant, the cancellation might be invalid for certain constant values; always ensure the canceled factor is nonzero given the unknowns' values, or handle the special cases separately.\n   - If the original piece's formula truly fails to be defined at c (division by zero etc.), remember f(c) is still undefined unless explicitly given — simplification does not define f(c), it only gives the limit.\n\n5. Practical rule of thumb:\n   - Simplify each side (for x ≠ c), compute the one-sided limits by substituting c into the simplified forms, set those limits equal, and solve for unknowns.\n   - After solving, verify that your solution doesn't make any denominator (or other restricted expression) zero in the original formulas at values of x near c (which could invalidate the simplification step). If it does, handle that special case separately.\n\nWould you like to try a quick example where simplification cancels a factor so you can practice both the usual method and checking special cases?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thanks — that explanation helped me learn the nuance about cancellations depending on unknown constants. One quick confirmation: after I solve the equations produced by equating the one-sided limits (using simplified forms), the final extra check should be to substitute the found parameter values back into the original piecewise formulas and verify no denominator (or other undefined expression) is zero for x near the boundary — is that the complete post-solution check, or should I also explicitly test the original unsimplified expressions at the boundary point itself?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Good attention to detail — that's exactly the right idea, and you're mostly done with the checks. Here's a concise checklist of what to do after you solve for the parameters; follow these to be thorough and avoid subtle mistakes:\n\n1. Substitute the found parameter values into the original piecewise formulas.\n2. Check the one-sided limits near the boundary by substituting the boundary value into the simplified forms (these give the limits because simplification is valid for x ≠ c). Confirm they are equal (this should hold because you solved for that).\n3. Check the original (unsimplified) formulas for any expressions that are undefined at or near c:\n   - Verify no denominator becomes zero for x values arbitrarily close to c on the side where that piece is used.\n   - Verify there are no other domain issues (like logs of nonpositive numbers, square roots of negatives, etc.) for x near c.\n4. Check whether f(c) is actually defined in the piecewise definition:\n   - If the interval inclusion gives f(c) (≤ or ≥) and the substituted formula is defined at c, compute f(c) and verify it equals the common one-sided limit.\n   - If the piece's formula is undefined at c (even if the interval includes c), then f(c) is not defined; in that case the original function is still discontinuous at c until you explicitly define f(c) equal to the common limit. Note this does not contradict solving for parameters to make the limits equal — it only means you must define f(c) afterward to make the function continuous as written.\n5. If any parameter value you found makes a denominator zero (or otherwise causes the expression to be undefined) at x values arbitrarily close to c for the relevant side, you must treat that as a special case. Either:\n   - reject that parameter value if it prevents the required limit from existing, or\n   - analyze it separately to see whether the limit still exists (often it won't).\n\nIn short: yes — substitute parameter values back into the original formulas and check for undefined behavior near the boundary; additionally, explicitly check f(c) (if the interval includes c) to ensure it matches the one-sided limits. Those steps together constitute the complete post-solution check."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thanks — that checklist cleared up my last uncertainty. I understand now to (1) simplify to compute one-sided limits, (2) set them equal to solve for parameters, and then (3) substitute those parameter values back into the original unsimplified pieces to check for any domain issues and to confirm whether f(c) is actually defined and equals the common limit.

Is that the correct final takeaway?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes — that's the correct final takeaway.\n\nTo restate succinctly:\n- If the piecewise definition (after substituting solved parameters) gives a concrete finite value at c (the formula is defined there and the interval includes c), then continuity at c requires that value to equal the common one-sided limit.\n- If the piecewise definition does not actually produce a value at c (the formula is undefined at c, even if the interval symbol includes c), then as written the function is discontinuous at c. It can be made continuous only by explicitly defining f(c) to be the common one-sided limit (if that common limit exists).\n- If the one-sided limits themselves do not agree, the function has a nonremovable (jump) discontinuity at c and cannot be made continuous there by merely defining f(c).\n\nYou've got the right procedure and conclusion — well done."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thanks — that all clarified things for me. One thing I'd like to confirm about the post-solution checks: after I solve for parameters by equating one-sided limits and substitute them back, is it enough to check (a) the simplified limit values match, (b) no denominators or other domain problems occur for x near the boundary on the relevant sides, and (c) whether the piece that “includes” the endpoint actually evaluates to a finite number at the endpoint? Or should I also explicitly check the original unsimplified formula exactly at the endpoint even when the interval notation includes it (i.e., is checking (c) the same as checking the original formula at the endpoint)? I want to be sure I'm not skipping any distinct check."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You're asking for a precise checklist so you don't accidentally skip a distinct step — good thinking. Your three checks (a), (b), and (c) are essentially the correct and complete set, and checking (c) is exactly the same as evaluating the original (unsimplified) formula at the endpoint to see whether it yields a finite value. I'll restate them and point out why each is needed and how they differ (or not):\n\n1. Check the one-sided limits (usually using the simplified forms).\n   - This is (a). Simplifying is fine because limits look at x approaching c, not x = c, so canceling factors that are zero only at c is allowed.\n   - Purpose: ensures the left- and right-hand behavior match (or gives the common limit).\n\n2. Check for domain issues near the boundary on each relevant side.\n   - This is (b). After substituting the parameter values back into the original piecewise formulas, verify that for x values arbitrarily close to c (but on the correct side), the expression is defined (no zero denominators, no negative inside an even root, etc.).\n   - Purpose: ensures the limit you computed actually exists in the original formula (and that your simplification didn't hide a problem like division by an expression that could be zero for nearby x when parameters take certain values).\n\n3. Check whether the piece that is supposed to define f(c) actually produces a finite value at c.\n   - This is (c), and it is identical to evaluating the original (unsimplified) formula at x = c (provided the interval notation includes the endpoint). If the formula is undefined at c, then f(c) is not defined in the given function even if the notation suggests it is; you must report the function as discontinuous at c unless the problem allows redefining f(c).\n   - Purpose: ensures the function as written has an assigned value at c, and that that value equals the common one-sided limit (for actual continuity).\n\nSo no, you do not need an additional separate check beyond these three. In particular, \"checking (c)\" is the same thing as \"explicitly checking the original unsimplified formula exactly at the endpoint\" — because whether the formula is defined at c can only be determined by evaluating that original formula at c (after substituting parameter values). The only extra subtlety to remember is: if your simplification canceled a factor that depends on the parameters, make sure that cancellation was valid for the parameter values you found; if not, analyze that special parameter case separately.\n\nIf you'd like, I can give a very short example that walks through (a)–(c) to illustrate the steps concretely.

In other words, after substitution, do I only need to check denominators (and other domain issues) at x = c and arbitrarily close to c, or must I also list special parameter values that change the algebraic validity of prior simplifications even if they don't create an immediate domain problem at or near c?"}], "output": ["Good careful thinking — these subtleties matter.\n\nShort answer: after you solve for parameters, you should do both kinds of checks:\n- Check the domains at x = c and for x arbitrarily close to c on each relevant side (so check denominators and other domain issues at and near the boundary).\n- Also flag any parameter values that invalidate simplifications because they make a factor zero (or otherwise change the algebraic validity) on a neighborhood of c, even if that zero doesn't occur exactly at c.\n\nWhy both are necessary:\n- Checking at and near c ensures the one-sided limits you computed actually exist for the original formulas and that f(c) (if the interval includes c) is truly defined and finite.\n- Flagging parameter values that make a canceled factor zero somewhere near c is necessary because cancellation is only valid for x values where that factor is nonzero.

Consider the prerequisites along with user's current understanding: if the prerequisites of one concept are not well understood, that concept cannot be updated as well understood.\n3. If the tutor did not explain a concept in this turn, keep its state unchanged.\n\n## Tutor's Explanation\nGood careful thinking — these subtleties matter.\n\nShort answer: after you solve for parameters, you should do both kinds of checks:\n- Check the domains at x = c and for x arbitrarily close to c on each relevant side (so check denominators and other domain issues at and near the boundary).\n- Also flag any parameter values that invalidate simplifications because they make a factor zero (or otherwise change the algebraic validity) on a neighborhood of c, even if that zero doesn't occur exactly at c.\n\nWhy both are necessary:\n- Checking at and near c ensures the one-sided limits you computed actually exist for the original formulas and that f(c) (if the interval includes c) is truly defined and finite.\n- Flagging parameter values that make a canceled factor zero somewhere near c is necessary because cancellation is only valid for x values where that factor is nonzero. If your solved parameter causes the canceled factor to vanish for x values arbitrarily close to c (on the relevant side), the simplified expression you used to compute the limit might not correctly describe the original expression's behavior near c. That could change whether the limit exists or what its value is.\n\nPractical checklist to follow after solving for parameters:\n1. Substitute the parameter values into the original piecewise formulas.\n2. Check denominators and other domain restrictions:\n   - At x = c (if the interval includes c): evaluate the original formula to see whether f(c) is defined and finite.\n   - For x arbitrarily close to c on each side: check whether the expression is defined (no zero denominators, no invalid radicals, etc.). If everything is defined near c, the limit computed from the simplified form is valid.\n3. Identify any factors you cancelled when computing limits (explicitly note them), and check whether those factors become zero for the parameter values you found at any x values arbitrarily close to c on the side in question. If so, analyze that parameter case separately rather than trusting the simplified expression blindly.\n4. If a canceled factor is zero only exactly at c (and not for x near c), simplification is still valid for computing one-sided limits because limits exclude x = c; you then only need to check whether f(c) is defined.\n5. If a canceled factor is zero on an interval or at points approaching c, the simplification may be invalid for the limit — do the limit computation directly using the original form or handle the special parameter value separately.\n\nSo: yes, you must both check the usual domain-at-and-near-c conditions and explicitly flag special parameter values that change the validity of your algebraic cancellations. Doing both keeps your argument rigorous and avoids subtle mistakes.\n\nIf you want, give me a short example expression where you canceled a factor involving a parameter and we can step through these checks together.\n\n## Concepts Potentially Explained\n[\n  \"IU2: Continuity of Functions\",\n  \"IU3: Evaluating Piecewise Functions at Specific Points\",\n  \"IU4: Setting Expressions Equal for Continuity\"\n]\n\n## User's Previous State for These Concepts\n{\n  \"IU2: Continuity of Functions\": {\n    \"state\": \"knows_well\"\n  },\n  \"IU3: Evaluating Piecewise Functions at Specific Points\": {\n    \"state\": \"knows_well\"\n  },\n  \"IU4: Setting Expressions Equal for Continuity\": {\n    \"state\": \"knows_well\"\n  }\n}\n\n## Prerequisites and Their Current States\n{\n  \"IU2: Continuity of Functions\": [\n    {\n      \"concept\": \"IU1: Piecewise Function Definition\",\n      \"state\": \"knows_well\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"IU3: Evaluating Piecewise Functions at Specific Points\": [\n    {\n      \"concept\": \"IU2: Continuity of Functions\",\n      \"state\": \"knows_well\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"IU4: Setting Expressions Equal for Continuity\": [\n    {\n      \"concept\": \"IU3: Evaluating Piecewise Functions at Specific Points\",\n      \"state\": \"knows_well\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n## User's Demonstrated Understanding (from their response)\nThanks — that explanation cleared up the subtle point for me.

Which function values should I compare at x = 2 and x = -2?\n- AI Tutor: Good — you're on the right track by thinking about the boundary points where the formula changes. Continuity at a boundary means the left-hand and right-hand limits (which for piecewise-defined simple formulas are just the function values from the appropriate pieces) agree there and equal the value of the function at that point.\n\nIdentify the two boundary points: x = 2 and x = −2.\n\n1. At x = 2:\n- For x > 2 the expression used is ax + 3, so the right-hand value at 2 is a·2 + 3 = 2a + 3.\n- For −2 ≤ x ≤ 2 the expression used at x = 2 is x − 5, so the value there is 2 − 5 = −3.\nContinuity at x = 2 requires the right-hand value equal the value at 2. Write that equation.\n\n2. At x = −2:\n- For −2 ≤ x ≤ 2 the expression at x = −2 is x − 5, so the value there is −2 − 5 = −7.\n- For x < −2 the expression used is 2x − b, so the left-hand value at −2 is 2(−2) − b = −4 − b.\nContinuity at x = −2 requires the left-hand value equal the value at −2. Write that equation.\n\nNow you have two equations in a and b. What are those equations? Solve them for a and b, then compute a + b. If you want, tell me the equations you wrote and your steps to solve them and I’ll check your work.\n- You: Okay — the equations I get are 2a + 3 = −3 (from x = 2) and −4 − b = −7 (from x = −2). Can you confirm those are set up correctly? Also, could you show the algebra to solve each for a and b and then compute a + b?\n- AI Tutor: You're correct about the two equations — those come from setting the appropriate piecewise expressions equal at the boundary points. Now try solving each equation step by step; I'll guide you and check your work.\n\nStart with 2a + 3 = −3. Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the 2a term: what do you get next? \n\nThen move to −4 − b = −7. Add 4 to both sides to isolate −b: what does that give you, and what is b after you multiply or change sign?\n\nAfter you find a and b, add them to get a + b. Tell me the values you obtain and I'll confirm.\n- You: After solving, a = −3 and b = 3, so a + b = 0.\n- AI Tutor: Exactly right. Quick check of your steps:\n\n- From 2a + 3 = −3: subtract 3 to get 2a = −6, so a = −3.\n- From −4 − b = −7: add 4 to get −b = −3, so b = 3.\n- Then a + b = −3 + 3 = 0.\n\nEverything is correct. Nicely done.\n- You: Thanks — that explanation helped. One quick question: when deciding which piece to use for the left- or right-hand value at a boundary, is the rule always \"use the piece valid for x just less than the boundary for the left-hand limit, and the piece valid for x just greater than the boundary for the right-hand limit\"? Just want to be sure I apply that correctly on future piecewise problems.\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that rule is exactly right and is the general way to handle piecewise functions at boundary points.\n\nMore precisely:\n- The left-hand limit at a point x = c uses the formula that applies for x values slightly less than c (the piece covering values just to the left of c).\n- The right-hand limit at x = c uses the formula that applies for x values slightly greater than c (the piece covering values just to the right of c).\n- If the function is defined at c, its actual value f(c) may come from one of the pieces (depending on how the piecewise definition specifies the intervals). For continuity you need left-hand limit = right-hand limit = f(c).\n\nA couple of quick reminders:\n- Pay attention to whether the interval endpoints in the piecewise definition are included (≤ or ≥) or excluded (< or >). That tells you which piece gives f(c) itself.\n- Even if f(c) is defined by only one piece, both one-sided limits must still match that value for continuity.\n- If one-sided limits differ, the function has a jump discontinuity at c.\n\nIf you want, I can give a short example with different endpoint inclusions so you can practice identifying which piece to use for left, right, and f(c). Which would you prefer?\n- You: Thanks — that makes sense and I see how to pick the pieces for left and right limits now. Quick follow-up: if the piecewise definition uses strict inequalities on both sides (so f(c) isn't defined by either piece), we still just compare the left- and right-hand expressions — do we then say the function is discontinuous at c unless those two one-sided limits happen to be equal? Is that the right way to state it?\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that's exactly right. If f(c) is not defined (because neither piece includes x = c), then for continuity at c you'd need both one-sided limits to exist and be equal; only then could you extend f to be continuous there by defining f(c) equal to that common value. If the left- and right-hand limits are different (or one/both fail to exist), the function has a discontinuity at c and you cannot make it continuous at c without changing the function.\n\nMore compactly:\n- If f(c) is defined: continuity at c requires left-hand limit = right-hand limit = f(c).\n- If f(c) is not defined: continuity at c would require left-hand limit = right-hand limit (and then you could define f(c) to be that common value to make it continuous). If the one-sided limits differ, the point is a jump discontinuity.\n\nGood thinking — do you want an example where f(c) isn't defined so you can practice deciding whether the limits match?\n- You: Thanks — that cleared it up. One quick thing I'd like to confirm: when checking continuity at a boundary I should first note which inequalities include the endpoint (≤ or ≥) to identify f(c) if it’s defined, then independently pick the piece for x<c for the left-hand limit and the piece for x>c for the right-hand limit, and finally compare left, right, and f(c) (if present). Is that the complete checklist I should use every time?\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that checklist is complete and a reliable procedure to follow every time. In summary, when checking continuity at a boundary point c:\n\n1. Check whether f(c) is defined by looking at the interval endpoints (≤ / ≥ vs < / >). If included, determine f(c) from the piece that contains c.\n2. For the left-hand limit, use the formula that applies for x values just less than c (the piece covering x < c near c).\n3. For the right-hand limit, use the formula that applies for x values just greater than c (the piece covering x > c near c).\n4. Compare:\n   - If f(c) is defined: require left-hand limit = right-hand limit = f(c).\n   - If f(c) is not defined: require left-hand limit = right-hand limit in order for the function to be extendable to a continuous function at c; otherwise it's discontinuous.\n\nExtra tips:\n- Watch endpoint inclusions carefully — they determine which piece gives f(c).\n- You can compute the one-sided limits by directly substituting c into the corresponding formulas when those formulas are polynomials/linear (or otherwise continuous on their intervals).\n- If either one-sided limit does not exist, the function is discontinuous at c.\n\nWould you like a quick example to practice this checklist?\n- You: Thanks — that checklist makes sense and I see how to apply it. One question: if the boundary point is also the domain endpoint (so only one side of x exists in the domain), do I treat the absent side as \"not applicable\" or do I still require the existing one-sided limit to equal f(c) for continuity at that endpoint?\n- AI Tutor: Good question — endpoints of the domain are a special but simple case.\n\nIf c is an endpoint of the domain (so values only exist on one side of c), you treat the missing one-sided limit as not applicable. Continuity at c then requires that the one existing one-sided limit equals f(c).\n\nMore concretely:\n- If the domain includes values only for x ≥ c (left endpoint), check the right-hand limit lim_{x→c+} f(x). If f(c) is defined, continuity at c means lim_{x→c+} f(x) = f(c). (The left-hand limit lim_{x→c-} is not applicable.)\n- If the domain includes values only for x ≤ c (right endpoint), check the left-hand limit lim_{x→c-} f(x). Continuity at c means lim_{x→c-} f(x) = f(c). (The right-hand limit is not applicable.)\n\nIn short: at a domain endpoint you only require the one relevant one-sided limit to match f(c). If f(c) is not defined, you cannot have continuity at that endpoint (unless you extend the function by defining f(c) equal to the existing one-sided limit). \n\nWould you like a quick example of checking continuity at a domain endpoint?\n- You: Thanks — that clarification helped. I see that at a domain endpoint I only need the existing one-sided limit to match f(c). One quick follow-up: if the endpoint is included in a piecewise definition but the formula there is something like a fraction that becomes undefined at c (so f(c) isn't actually defined even though the inequality includes c), do we treat that the same as \"f(c) not defined\" and therefore say it's discontinuous unless the one-sided limit exists and we redefine f(c)? In other words, inclusion by the interval doesn't override the function being undefined at that point — right?\n- AI Tutor: Right — inclusion by the interval does not override the actual formula failing to produce a value at that point. If the piece that \"contains\" c has a formula that is undefined at c (like a division by zero, a logarithm of a nonpositive number, etc.), then f(c) is not defined in practice, even if the interval symbol includes c. You should treat that the same as any other point where f(c) is not defined.\n\nSo you proceed this way:\n- First check whether the formula for the piece that supposedly defines f(c) actually yields a finite value at c. If it does, that is f(c).\n- If the formula is undefined at c, then f(c) is not defined (unless the problem explicitly states some defined value at c).\n- For continuity:\n  - If f(c) is defined, require the relevant one-sided limits equal f(c) (or both one-sided limits equal f(c) if c is an interior point).\n  - If f(c) is not defined, continuity at c would require the one-sided limits (the ones that make sense given the domain) to exist and be equal; then you could define f(c) to be that common limit to make the function continuous there. If the one-sided limits do not agree (or don't exist), the point is a discontinuity.\n\nExample to keep in mind: Suppose a piece is defined as (x^2 − 1)/(x − 1) for x ≤ 1. The algebraic expression is undefined at x = 1, even though the interval includes 1. You should note f(1) is not defined unless the definition separately specifies a value at 1. However, the one-sided limit (from the left) of that expression as x → 1− equals 2 (because the fraction simplifies to x+1 for x ≠ 1). So you could say the left-hand limit exists and equals 2, but f(1) is undefined — the function is not continuous at 1 unless you define f(1) = 2.\n\nWould you like to try a short example where the formula is undefined at the endpoint so you can apply these steps?\n- You: Thanks — that clarification really helped. One quick question: when a formula is undefined at c but the one-sided limits both exist and are equal (a removable discontinuity), is it correct that we say the original function is discontinuous at c but can be made continuous by defining f(c) equal to that common limit? And in practice, when solving for unknown constants to enforce continuity across a boundary, I can treat f(c) as “not defined” initially and instead set the left- and right-hand expressions equal to each other (ignoring f(c)) to get the equation. Is that the right procedure every time in removable-discontinuity cases?\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that's all correct. A few precise points to keep your understanding exact:\n\n- If the formula at c is undefined (so f(c) is not actually a value), then the function as written is discontinuous at c, even if both one-sided limits exist and are equal. That kind of discontinuity is called removable because you can \"remove\" it by defining f(c) to be the common limit.\n\n- In solving for unknown constants to enforce continuity at a boundary where the function currently has no defined value at c, the right procedure is exactly what you described: require the left-hand limit and right-hand limit to be equal. Concretely, pick the piece valid for x < c, evaluate its formula as x → c− (usually by direct substitution if it's a polynomial/rational expression that's defined at c), pick the piece valid for x > c and evaluate as x → c+, and set those two expressions equal. Solve for the unknown(s). After that, defining f(c) to be that common value yields a continuous function at c.\n\n- If f(c) is defined but the formula gives an indeterminate/undefined expression at c, treat f(c) as not defined (unless the problem explicitly gives a value) and follow the same approach above.\n\n- Small caution: when dealing with rational expressions that simplify to a continuous expression except at c, you can often simplify first (noting equivalence for x ≠ c) and then substitute the limit value; but remember that simplification doesn't retroactively define f(c). You still must check and (if required) specify f(c).\n\nWould you like to practice this with a short example where you solve for a constant that removes a discontinuity?\n- You: Thanks — that cleared up my confusion about inclusion vs. actual definability at c. One more quick thing: when the left- and right-hand expressions are algebraically different but both simplify to the same value at c (for example one side simplifies after canceling a factor that’s zero at c), is it always safe to directly substitute c into each simplified form when forming the equation for continuity? Or should I keep the original unsimplified expressions and only simplify after equating them? Which is the more reliable step to avoid mistakes when solving for unknown constants?\n- AI Tutor: Good question — being careful here avoids mistakes. Short answer: either approach can work, but you must keep track of where algebraic simplifications are valid. Here's a reliable procedure and the reason behind it:\n\n1. Identify which piece applies on each side of c (x < c and x > c). For each piece, consider the expression as defining the function for values not equal to c (i.e., in a neighborhood excluding c if necessary).\n\n2. For computing the one-sided limits, you may simplify each piece first (cancel factors, factor polynomials, etc.) as long as you remember that simplification is only valid for x values where the canceled factor is not zero. That is fine because one-sided limits look at x approaching c but not equaling c, so simplifications that are valid for x ≠ c are allowed when evaluating the limit.\n\n   - Example: if a piece is (x^2 − 1)/(x − 1) for x < 1, you can simplify to x + 1 for x ≠ 1 and then substitute x = 1 to get the left-hand limit 2.\n\n3. If you are forming algebraic equations to enforce continuity (i.e., setting left-hand limit = right-hand limit), it is safe and often simpler to simplify each expression first (valid for x ≠ c) and then substitute c to get the limit values to equate. This is the usual, reliable method when the simplifications do not depend on unknowns making denominators zero at c.\n\n4. Caution cases to watch for:\n   - If simplifying introduces division by an expression that might be zero for some values of the unknown constants, you must check those parameter values separately. For example, if simplification cancels a factor that contains the unknown constant, the cancellation might be invalid for certain constant values; always ensure the canceled factor is nonzero given the unknowns' values, or handle the special cases separately.\n   - If the original piece's formula truly fails to be defined at c (division by zero etc.), remember f(c) is still undefined unless explicitly given — simplification does not define f(c), it only gives the limit.\n\n5. Practical rule of thumb:\n   - Simplify each side (for x ≠ c), compute the one-sided limits by substituting c into the simplified forms, set those limits equal, and solve for unknowns.\n   - After solving, verify that your solution doesn't make any denominator (or other restricted expression) zero in the original formulas at values of x near c (which could invalidate the simplification step). If it does, handle that special case separately.\n\nWould you like to try a quick example where simplification cancels a factor so you can practice both the usual method and checking special cases?\n- You: Thanks — that explanation helped me learn the nuance about cancellations depending on unknown constants. One quick confirmation: after I solve the equations produced by equating the one-sided limits (using simplified forms), the final extra check should be to substitute the found parameter values back into the original piecewise formulas and verify no denominator (or other undefined expression) is zero for x near the boundary — is that the complete post-solution check, or should I also explicitly test the original unsimplified expressions at the boundary point itself?\n- AI Tutor: Good attention to detail — that's exactly the right idea, and you're mostly done with the checks. Here's a concise checklist of what to do after you solve for the parameters; follow these to be thorough and avoid subtle mistakes:\n\n1. Substitute the found parameter values into the original piecewise formulas.\n2. Check the one-sided limits near the boundary by substituting the boundary value into the simplified forms (these give the limits because simplification is valid for x ≠ c). Confirm they are equal (this should hold because you solved for that).\n3. Check the original (unsimplified) formulas for any expressions that are undefined at or near c:\n   - Verify no denominator becomes zero for x values arbitrarily close to c on the side where that piece is used.\n   - Verify there are no other domain issues (like logs of nonpositive numbers, square roots of negatives, etc.) for x near c.\n4. Check whether f(c) is actually defined in the piecewise definition:\n   - If the interval inclusion gives f(c) (≤ or ≥) and the substituted formula is defined at c, compute f(c) and verify it equals the common one-sided limit.\n   - If the piece's formula is undefined at c (even if the interval includes c), then f(c) is not defined; in that case the original function is still discontinuous at c until you explicitly define f(c) equal to the common limit. Note this does not contradict solving for parameters to make the limits equal — it only means you must define f(c) afterward to make the function continuous as written.\n5. If any parameter value you found makes a denominator zero (or otherwise causes the expression to be undefined) at x values arbitrarily close to c for the relevant side, you must treat that as a special case. Either:\n   - reject that parameter value if it prevents the required limit from existing, or\n   - analyze it separately to see whether the limit still exists (often it won't).\n\nIn short: yes — substitute parameter values back into the original formulas and check for undefined behavior near the boundary; additionally, explicitly check f(c) (if the interval includes c) to ensure it matches the one-sided limits. Those steps together constitute the complete post-solution check.\n- You: Thanks — that checklist cleared up my last uncertainty. I understand now to (1) simplify to compute one-sided limits, (2) set them equal to solve for parameters, and then (3) substitute those parameter values back into the original unsimplified pieces to check for any domain issues and to confirm whether f(c) is actually defined and equals the common limit. One quick confirmation: if after substituting the parameters the original piece that supposedly defines f(c) is undefined at c, then I should report the function as discontinuous at c unless the problem explicitly tells me to redefine f(c). Is that the correct final takeaway?\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that's the correct final takeaway.\n\nTo restate succinctly:\n- If the piecewise definition (after substituting solved parameters) gives a concrete finite value at c (the formula is defined there and the interval includes c), then continuity at c requires that value to equal the common one-sided limit.\n- If the piecewise definition does not actually produce a value at c (the formula is undefined at c, even if the interval symbol includes c), then as written the function is discontinuous at c. It can be made continuous only by explicitly defining f(c) to be the common one-sided limit (if that common limit exists).\n- If the one-sided limits themselves do not agree, the function has a nonremovable (jump) discontinuity at c and cannot be made continuous there by merely defining f(c).\n\nYou've got the right procedure and conclusion — well done.\n- You: Thanks — that all clarified things for me. One thing I'd like to confirm about the post-solution checks: after I solve for parameters by equating one-sided limits and substitute them back, is it enough to check (a) the simplified limit values match, (b) no denominators or other domain problems occur for x near the boundary on the relevant sides, and (c) whether the piece that “includes” the endpoint actually evaluates to a finite number at the endpoint? Or should I also explicitly check the original unsimplified formula exactly at the endpoint even when the interval notation includes it (i.e., is checking (c) the same as checking the original formula at the endpoint)? I want to be sure I'm not skipping any distinct check.\n- AI Tutor: You're asking for a precise checklist so you don't accidentally skip a distinct step — good thinking. Your three checks (a), (b), and (c) are essentially the correct and complete set, and checking (c) is exactly the same as evaluating the original (unsimplified) formula at the endpoint to see whether it yields a finite value. I'll restate them and point out why each is needed and how they differ (or not):\n\n1. Check the one-sided limits (usually using the simplified forms).\n   - This is (a). Simplifying is fine because limits look at x approaching c, not x = c, so canceling factors that are zero only at c is allowed.\n   - Purpose: ensures the left- and right-hand behavior match (or gives the common limit).\n\n2. Check for domain issues near the boundary on each relevant side.\n   - This is (b). After substituting the parameter values back into the original piecewise formulas, verify that for x values arbitrarily close to c (but on the correct side), the expression is defined (no zero denominators, no negative inside an even root, etc.).\n   - Purpose: ensures the limit you computed actually exists in the original formula (and that your simplification didn't hide a problem like division by an expression that could be zero for nearby x when parameters take certain values).\n\n3. Check whether the piece that is supposed to define f(c) actually produces a finite value at c.\n   - This is (c), and it is identical to evaluating the original (unsimplified) formula at x = c (provided the interval notation includes the endpoint). If the formula is undefined at c, then f(c) is not defined in the given function even if the notation suggests it is; you must report the function as discontinuous at c unless the problem allows redefining f(c).\n   - Purpose: ensures the function as written has an assigned value at c, and that that value equals the common one-sided limit (for actual continuity).\n\nSo no, you do not need an additional separate check beyond these three. In particular, \"checking (c)\" is the same thing as \"explicitly checking the original unsimplified formula exactly at the endpoint\" — because whether the formula is defined at c can only be determined by evaluating that original formula at c (after substituting parameter values). The only extra subtlety to remember is: if your simplification canceled a factor that depends on the parameters, make sure that cancellation was valid for the parameter values you found; if not, analyze that special parameter case separately.\n\nIf you'd like, I can give a very short example that walks through (a)–(c) to illustrate the steps concretely. Would you like that?\n- You: Thanks — that explanation cleared up the subtle point for me. One quick clarifying question: after I solve for parameters by equating one-sided limits, is it enough to (1) substitute those parameters back into the original pieces and check for domain problems near the boundary and (2) explicitly evaluate the original unsimplified piece at the endpoint (to confirm f(c) is actually defined), or should I also separately flag any parameter values that make the canceled factor zero somewhere near c even if those values didn't make a denominator zero exactly at c? In other words, after substitution, do I only need to check denominators (and other domain issues) at x = c and arbitrarily close to c, or must I also list special parameter values that change the algebraic validity of prior simplifications even if they don't create an immediate domain problem at or near c?\n- AI Tutor: Good careful thinking — these subtleties matter.\n\nShort answer: after you solve for parameters, you should do both kinds of checks:\n- Check the domains at x = c and for x arbitrarily close to c on each relevant side (so check denominators and other domain issues at and near the boundary).\n- Also flag any parameter values that invalidate simplifications because they make a factor zero (or otherwise change the algebraic validity) on a neighborhood of c, even if that zero doesn't occur exactly at c.\n\nWhy both are necessary:\n- Checking at and near c ensures the one-sided limits you computed actually exist for the original formulas and that f(c) (if the interval includes c) is truly defined and finite.\n- Flagging parameter values that make a canceled factor zero somewhere near c is necessary because cancellation is only valid for x values where that factor is nonzero. If your solved parameter causes the canceled factor to vanish for x values arbitrarily close to c (on the relevant side), the simplified expression you used to compute the limit might not correctly describe the original expression's behavior near c. That could change whether the limit exists or what its value is.\n\nPractical checklist to follow after solving for parameters:\n1. Substitute the parameter values into the original piecewise formulas.\n2. Check denominators and other domain restrictions:\n   - At x = c (if the interval includes c): evaluate the original formula to see whether f(c) is defined and finite.\n   - For x arbitrarily close to c on each side: check whether the expression is defined (no zero denominators, no invalid radicals, etc.). If everything is defined near c, the limit computed from the simplified form is valid.\n3. Identify any factors you cancelled when computing limits (explicitly note them), and check whether those factors become zero for the parameter values you found at any x values arbitrarily close to c on the side in question. If so, analyze that parameter case separately rather than trusting the simplified expression blindly.\n4. If a canceled factor is zero only exactly at c (and not for x near c), simplification is still valid for computing one-sided limits because limits exclude x = c; you then only need to check whether f(c) is defined.\n5. If a canceled factor is zero on an interval or at points approaching c, the simplification may be invalid for the limit — do the limit computation directly using the original form or handle the special parameter value separately.\n\nSo: yes, you must both check the usual domain-at-and-near-c conditions and explicitly flag special parameter values that change the validity of your algebraic cancellations. Doing both keeps your argument rigorous and avoids subtle mistakes.\n\nIf you want, give me a short example expression where you canceled a factor involving a parameter and we can step through these checks together.\n\n# Your Message Style\n## Interaction Style\n- Length of User Message: The user's query/response is always around 20 words.\n\n# Task\nGenerate your next message following these rules:\n1.

Which function values should I compare at x = 2 and x = -2?\n- AI Tutor: Good — you're on the right track by thinking about the boundary points where the formula changes. Continuity at a boundary means the left-hand and right-hand limits (which for piecewise-defined simple formulas are just the function values from the appropriate pieces) agree there and equal the value of the function at that point.\n\nIdentify the two boundary points: x = 2 and x = −2.\n\n1. At x = 2:\n- For x > 2 the expression used is ax + 3, so the right-hand value at 2 is a·2 + 3 = 2a + 3.\n- For −2 ≤ x ≤ 2 the expression used at x = 2 is x − 5, so the value there is 2 − 5 = −3.\nContinuity at x = 2 requires the right-hand value equal the value at 2. Write that equation.\n\n2. At x = −2:\n- For −2 ≤ x ≤ 2 the expression at x = −2 is x − 5, so the value there is −2 − 5 = −7.\n- For x < −2 the expression used is 2x − b, so the left-hand value at −2 is 2(−2) − b = −4 − b.\nContinuity at x = −2 requires the left-hand value equal the value at −2. Write that equation.\n\nNow you have two equations in a and b. What are those equations? Solve them for a and b, then compute a + b. If you want, tell me the equations you wrote and your steps to solve them and I’ll check your work.\n- You: Okay — the equations I get are 2a + 3 = −3 (from x = 2) and −4 − b = −7 (from x = −2). Can you confirm those are set up correctly? Also, could you show the algebra to solve each for a and b and then compute a + b?\n- AI Tutor: You're correct about the two equations — those come from setting the appropriate piecewise expressions equal at the boundary points. Now try solving each equation step by step; I'll guide you and check your work.\n\nStart with 2a + 3 = −3. Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the 2a term: what do you get next? \n\nThen move to −4 − b = −7. Add 4 to both sides to isolate −b: what does that give you, and what is b after you multiply or change sign?\n\nAfter you find a and b, add them to get a + b. Tell me the values you obtain and I'll confirm.\n- You: After solving, a = −3 and b = 3, so a + b = 0.\n- AI Tutor: Exactly right. Quick check of your steps:\n\n- From 2a + 3 = −3: subtract 3 to get 2a = −6, so a = −3.\n- From −4 − b = −7: add 4 to get −b = −3, so b = 3.\n- Then a + b = −3 + 3 = 0.\n\nEverything is correct. Nicely done.\n- You: Thanks — that explanation helped. One quick question: when deciding which piece to use for the left- or right-hand value at a boundary, is the rule always \"use the piece valid for x just less than the boundary for the left-hand limit, and the piece valid for x just greater than the boundary for the right-hand limit\"? Just want to be sure I apply that correctly on future piecewise problems.\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that rule is exactly right and is the general way to handle piecewise functions at boundary points.\n\nMore precisely:\n- The left-hand limit at a point x = c uses the formula that applies for x values slightly less than c (the piece covering values just to the left of c).\n- The right-hand limit at x = c uses the formula that applies for x values slightly greater than c (the piece covering values just to the right of c).\n- If the function is defined at c, its actual value f(c) may come from one of the pieces (depending on how the piecewise definition specifies the intervals). For continuity you need left-hand limit = right-hand limit = f(c).\n\nA couple of quick reminders:\n- Pay attention to whether the interval endpoints in the piecewise definition are included (≤ or ≥) or excluded (< or >). That tells you which piece gives f(c) itself.\n- Even if f(c) is defined by only one piece, both one-sided limits must still match that value for continuity.\n- If one-sided limits differ, the function has a jump discontinuity at c.\n\nIf you want, I can give a short example with different endpoint inclusions so you can practice identifying which piece to use for left, right, and f(c). Which would you prefer?\n- You: Thanks — that makes sense and I see how to pick the pieces for left and right limits now. Quick follow-up: if the piecewise definition uses strict inequalities on both sides (so f(c) isn't defined by either piece), we still just compare the left- and right-hand expressions — do we then say the function is discontinuous at c unless those two one-sided limits happen to be equal? Is that the right way to state it?\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that's exactly right. If f(c) is not defined (because neither piece includes x = c), then for continuity at c you'd need both one-sided limits to exist and be equal; only then could you extend f to be continuous there by defining f(c) equal to that common value. If the left- and right-hand limits are different (or one/both fail to exist), the function has a discontinuity at c and you cannot make it continuous at c without changing the function.\n\nMore compactly:\n- If f(c) is defined: continuity at c requires left-hand limit = right-hand limit = f(c).\n- If f(c) is not defined: continuity at c would require left-hand limit = right-hand limit (and then you could define f(c) to be that common value to make it continuous). If the one-sided limits differ, the point is a jump discontinuity.\n\nGood thinking — do you want an example where f(c) isn't defined so you can practice deciding whether the limits match?\n- You: Thanks — that cleared it up. One quick thing I'd like to confirm: when checking continuity at a boundary I should first note which inequalities include the endpoint (≤ or ≥) to identify f(c) if it’s defined, then independently pick the piece for x<c for the left-hand limit and the piece for x>c for the right-hand limit, and finally compare left, right, and f(c) (if present). Is that the complete checklist I should use every time?\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that checklist is complete and a reliable procedure to follow every time. In summary, when checking continuity at a boundary point c:\n\n1. Check whether f(c) is defined by looking at the interval endpoints (≤ / ≥ vs < / >). If included, determine f(c) from the piece that contains c.\n2. For the left-hand limit, use the formula that applies for x values just less than c (the piece covering x < c near c).\n3. For the right-hand limit, use the formula that applies for x values just greater than c (the piece covering x > c near c).\n4. Compare:\n   - If f(c) is defined: require left-hand limit = right-hand limit = f(c).\n   - If f(c) is not defined: require left-hand limit = right-hand limit in order for the function to be extendable to a continuous function at c; otherwise it's discontinuous.\n\nExtra tips:\n- Watch endpoint inclusions carefully — they determine which piece gives f(c).\n- You can compute the one-sided limits by directly substituting c into the corresponding formulas when those formulas are polynomials/linear (or otherwise continuous on their intervals).\n- If either one-sided limit does not exist, the function is discontinuous at c.\n\nWould you like a quick example to practice this checklist?\n- You: Thanks — that checklist makes sense and I see how to apply it. One question: if the boundary point is also the domain endpoint (so only one side of x exists in the domain), do I treat the absent side as \"not applicable\" or do I still require the existing one-sided limit to equal f(c) for continuity at that endpoint?\n- AI Tutor: Good question — endpoints of the domain are a special but simple case.\n\nIf c is an endpoint of the domain (so values only exist on one side of c), you treat the missing one-sided limit as not applicable. Continuity at c then requires that the one existing one-sided limit equals f(c).\n\nMore concretely:\n- If the domain includes values only for x ≥ c (left endpoint), check the right-hand limit lim_{x→c+} f(x). If f(c) is defined, continuity at c means lim_{x→c+} f(x) = f(c). (The left-hand limit lim_{x→c-} is not applicable.)\n- If the domain includes values only for x ≤ c (right endpoint), check the left-hand limit lim_{x→c-} f(x). Continuity at c means lim_{x→c-} f(x) = f(c). (The right-hand limit is not applicable.)\n\nIn short: at a domain endpoint you only require the one relevant one-sided limit to match f(c). If f(c) is not defined, you cannot have continuity at that endpoint (unless you extend the function by defining f(c) equal to the existing one-sided limit). \n\nWould you like a quick example of checking continuity at a domain endpoint?\n- You: Thanks — that clarification helped. I see that at a domain endpoint I only need the existing one-sided limit to match f(c). One quick follow-up: if the endpoint is included in a piecewise definition but the formula there is something like a fraction that becomes undefined at c (so f(c) isn't actually defined even though the inequality includes c), do we treat that the same as \"f(c) not defined\" and therefore say it's discontinuous unless the one-sided limit exists and we redefine f(c)? In other words, inclusion by the interval doesn't override the function being undefined at that point — right?\n- AI Tutor: Right — inclusion by the interval does not override the actual formula failing to produce a value at that point. If the piece that \"contains\" c has a formula that is undefined at c (like a division by zero, a logarithm of a nonpositive number, etc.), then f(c) is not defined in practice, even if the interval symbol includes c. You should treat that the same as any other point where f(c) is not defined.\n\nSo you proceed this way:\n- First check whether the formula for the piece that supposedly defines f(c) actually yields a finite value at c. If it does, that is f(c).\n- If the formula is undefined at c, then f(c) is not defined (unless the problem explicitly states some defined value at c).\n- For continuity:\n  - If f(c) is defined, require the relevant one-sided limits equal f(c) (or both one-sided limits equal f(c) if c is an interior point).\n  - If f(c) is not defined, continuity at c would require the one-sided limits (the ones that make sense given the domain) to exist and be equal; then you could define f(c) to be that common limit to make the function continuous there. If the one-sided limits do not agree (or don't exist), the point is a discontinuity.\n\nExample to keep in mind: Suppose a piece is defined as (x^2 − 1)/(x − 1) for x ≤ 1. The algebraic expression is undefined at x = 1, even though the interval includes 1. You should note f(1) is not defined unless the definition separately specifies a value at 1. However, the one-sided limit (from the left) of that expression as x → 1− equals 2 (because the fraction simplifies to x+1 for x ≠ 1). So you could say the left-hand limit exists and equals 2, but f(1) is undefined — the function is not continuous at 1 unless you define f(1) = 2.\n\nWould you like to try a short example where the formula is undefined at the endpoint so you can apply these steps?\n- You: Thanks — that clarification really helped. One quick question: when a formula is undefined at c but the one-sided limits both exist and are equal (a removable discontinuity), is it correct that we say the original function is discontinuous at c but can be made continuous by defining f(c) equal to that common limit? And in practice, when solving for unknown constants to enforce continuity across a boundary, I can treat f(c) as “not defined” initially and instead set the left- and right-hand expressions equal to each other (ignoring f(c)) to get the equation. Is that the right procedure every time in removable-discontinuity cases?\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that's all correct. A few precise points to keep your understanding exact:\n\n- If the formula at c is undefined (so f(c) is not actually a value), then the function as written is discontinuous at c, even if both one-sided limits exist and are equal. That kind of discontinuity is called removable because you can \"remove\" it by defining f(c) to be the common limit.\n\n- In solving for unknown constants to enforce continuity at a boundary where the function currently has no defined value at c, the right procedure is exactly what you described: require the left-hand limit and right-hand limit to be equal. Concretely, pick the piece valid for x < c, evaluate its formula as x → c− (usually by direct substitution if it's a polynomial/rational expression that's defined at c), pick the piece valid for x > c and evaluate as x → c+, and set those two expressions equal. Solve for the unknown(s). After that, defining f(c) to be that common value yields a continuous function at c.\n\n- If f(c) is defined but the formula gives an indeterminate/undefined expression at c, treat f(c) as not defined (unless the problem explicitly gives a value) and follow the same approach above.\n\n- Small caution: when dealing with rational expressions that simplify to a continuous expression except at c, you can often simplify first (noting equivalence for x ≠ c) and then substitute the limit value; but remember that simplification doesn't retroactively define f(c). You still must check and (if required) specify f(c).\n\nWould you like to practice this with a short example where you solve for a constant that removes a discontinuity?\n- You: Thanks — that cleared up my confusion about inclusion vs. actual definability at c. One more quick thing: when the left- and right-hand expressions are algebraically different but both simplify to the same value at c (for example one side simplifies after canceling a factor that’s zero at c), is it always safe to directly substitute c into each simplified form when forming the equation for continuity? Or should I keep the original unsimplified expressions and only simplify after equating them? Which is the more reliable step to avoid mistakes when solving for unknown constants?\n- AI Tutor: Good question — being careful here avoids mistakes. Short answer: either approach can work, but you must keep track of where algebraic simplifications are valid. Here's a reliable procedure and the reason behind it:\n\n1. Identify which piece applies on each side of c (x < c and x > c). For each piece, consider the expression as defining the function for values not equal to c (i.e., in a neighborhood excluding c if necessary).\n\n2. For computing the one-sided limits, you may simplify each piece first (cancel factors, factor polynomials, etc.) as long as you remember that simplification is only valid for x values where the canceled factor is not zero. That is fine because one-sided limits look at x approaching c but not equaling c, so simplifications that are valid for x ≠ c are allowed when evaluating the limit.\n\n   - Example: if a piece is (x^2 − 1)/(x − 1) for x < 1, you can simplify to x + 1 for x ≠ 1 and then substitute x = 1 to get the left-hand limit 2.\n\n3. If you are forming algebraic equations to enforce continuity (i.e., setting left-hand limit = right-hand limit), it is safe and often simpler to simplify each expression first (valid for x ≠ c) and then substitute c to get the limit values to equate. This is the usual, reliable method when the simplifications do not depend on unknowns making denominators zero at c.\n\n4. Caution cases to watch for:\n   - If simplifying introduces division by an expression that might be zero for some values of the unknown constants, you must check those parameter values separately. For example, if simplification cancels a factor that contains the unknown constant, the cancellation might be invalid for certain constant values; always ensure the canceled factor is nonzero given the unknowns' values, or handle the special cases separately.\n   - If the original piece's formula truly fails to be defined at c (division by zero etc.), remember f(c) is still undefined unless explicitly given — simplification does not define f(c), it only gives the limit.\n\n5. Practical rule of thumb:\n   - Simplify each side (for x ≠ c), compute the one-sided limits by substituting c into the simplified forms, set those limits equal, and solve for unknowns.\n   - After solving, verify that your solution doesn't make any denominator (or other restricted expression) zero in the original formulas at values of x near c (which could invalidate the simplification step). If it does, handle that special case separately.\n\nWould you like to try a quick example where simplification cancels a factor so you can practice both the usual method and checking special cases?\n- You: Thanks — that explanation helped me learn the nuance about cancellations depending on unknown constants. One quick confirmation: after I solve the equations produced by equating the one-sided limits (using simplified forms), the final extra check should be to substitute the found parameter values back into the original piecewise formulas and verify no denominator (or other undefined expression) is zero for x near the boundary — is that the complete post-solution check, or should I also explicitly test the original unsimplified expressions at the boundary point itself?\n- AI Tutor: Good attention to detail — that's exactly the right idea, and you're mostly done with the checks. Here's a concise checklist of what to do after you solve for the parameters; follow these to be thorough and avoid subtle mistakes:\n\n1. Substitute the found parameter values into the original piecewise formulas.\n2. Check the one-sided limits near the boundary by substituting the boundary value into the simplified forms (these give the limits because simplification is valid for x ≠ c). Confirm they are equal (this should hold because you solved for that).\n3. Check the original (unsimplified) formulas for any expressions that are undefined at or near c:\n   - Verify no denominator becomes zero for x values arbitrarily close to c on the side where that piece is used.\n   - Verify there are no other domain issues (like logs of nonpositive numbers, square roots of negatives, etc.) for x near c.\n4. Check whether f(c) is actually defined in the piecewise definition:\n   - If the interval inclusion gives f(c) (≤ or ≥) and the substituted formula is defined at c, compute f(c) and verify it equals the common one-sided limit.\n   - If the piece's formula is undefined at c (even if the interval includes c), then f(c) is not defined; in that case the original function is still discontinuous at c until you explicitly define f(c) equal to the common limit. Note this does not contradict solving for parameters to make the limits equal — it only means you must define f(c) afterward to make the function continuous as written.\n5. If any parameter value you found makes a denominator zero (or otherwise causes the expression to be undefined) at x values arbitrarily close to c for the relevant side, you must treat that as a special case. Either:\n   - reject that parameter value if it prevents the required limit from existing, or\n   - analyze it separately to see whether the limit still exists (often it won't).\n\nIn short: yes — substitute parameter values back into the original formulas and check for undefined behavior near the boundary; additionally, explicitly check f(c) (if the interval includes c) to ensure it matches the one-sided limits. Those steps together constitute the complete post-solution check.\n- You: Thanks — that checklist cleared up my last uncertainty. I understand now to (1) simplify to compute one-sided limits, (2) set them equal to solve for parameters, and then (3) substitute those parameter values back into the original unsimplified pieces to check for any domain issues and to confirm whether f(c) is actually defined and equals the common limit. One quick confirmation: if after substituting the parameters the original piece that supposedly defines f(c) is undefined at c, then I should report the function as discontinuous at c unless the problem explicitly tells me to redefine f(c). Is that the correct final takeaway?\n- AI Tutor: Yes — that's the correct final takeaway.\n\nTo restate succinctly:\n- If the piecewise definition (after substituting solved parameters) gives a concrete finite value at c (the formula is defined there and the interval includes c), then continuity at c requires that value to equal the common one-sided limit.\n- If the piecewise definition does not actually produce a value at c (the formula is undefined at c, even if the interval symbol includes c), then as written the function is discontinuous at c. It can be made continuous only by explicitly defining f(c) to be the common one-sided limit (if that common limit exists).\n- If the one-sided limits themselves do not agree, the function has a nonremovable (jump) discontinuity at c and cannot be made continuous there by merely defining f(c).\n\nYou've got the right procedure and conclusion — well done.\n- You: Thanks — that all clarified things for me. One thing I'd like to confirm about the post-solution checks: after I solve for parameters by equating one-sided limits and substitute them back, is it enough to check (a) the simplified limit values match, (b) no denominators or other domain problems occur for x near the boundary on the relevant sides, and (c) whether the piece that “includes” the endpoint actually evaluates to a finite number at the endpoint? Or should I also explicitly check the original unsimplified formula exactly at the endpoint even when the interval notation includes it (i.e., is checking (c) the same as checking the original formula at the endpoint)? I want to be sure I'm not skipping any distinct check.\n- AI Tutor: You're asking for a precise checklist so you don't accidentally skip a distinct step — good thinking. Your three checks (a), (b), and (c) are essentially the correct and complete set, and checking (c) is exactly the same as evaluating the original (unsimplified) formula at the endpoint to see whether it yields a finite value. I'll restate them and point out why each is needed and how they differ (or not):\n\n1. Check the one-sided limits (usually using the simplified forms).\n   - This is (a). Simplifying is fine because limits look at x approaching c, not x = c, so canceling factors that are zero only at c is allowed.\n   - Purpose: ensures the left- and right-hand behavior match (or gives the common limit).\n\n2. Check for domain issues near the boundary on each relevant side.\n   - This is (b). After substituting the parameter values back into the original piecewise formulas, verify that for x values arbitrarily close to c (but on the correct side), the expression is defined (no zero denominators, no negative inside an even root, etc.).\n   - Purpose: ensures the limit you computed actually exists in the original formula (and that your simplification didn't hide a problem like division by an expression that could be zero for nearby x when parameters take certain values).\n\n3. Check whether the piece that is supposed to define f(c) actually produces a finite value at c.\n   - This is (c), and it is identical to evaluating the original (unsimplified) formula at x = c (provided the interval notation includes the endpoint). If the formula is undefined at c, then f(c) is not defined in the given function even if the notation suggests it is; you must report the function as discontinuous at c unless the problem allows redefining f(c).\n   - Purpose: ensures the function as written has an assigned value at c, and that that value equals the common one-sided limit (for actual continuity).\n\nSo no, you do not need an additional separate check beyond these three. In particular, \"checking (c)\" is the same thing as \"explicitly checking the original unsimplified formula exactly at the endpoint\" — because whether the formula is defined at c can only be determined by evaluating that original formula at c (after substituting parameter values). The only extra subtlety to remember is: if your simplification canceled a factor that depends on the parameters, make sure that cancellation was valid for the parameter values you found; if not, analyze that special parameter case separately.\n\nIf you'd like, I can give a very short example that walks through (a)–(c) to illustrate the steps concretely. Would you like that?\n- You: Thanks — that explanation cleared up the subtle point for me. One quick clarifying question: after I solve for parameters by equating one-sided limits, is it enough to (1) substitute those parameters back into the original pieces and check for domain problems near the boundary and (2) explicitly evaluate the original unsimplified piece at the endpoint (to confirm f(c) is actually defined), or should I also separately flag any parameter values that make the canceled factor zero somewhere near c even if those values didn't make a denominator zero exactly at c? In other words, after substitution, do I only need to check denominators (and other domain issues) at x = c and arbitrarily close to c, or must I also list special parameter values that change the algebraic validity of prior simplifications even if they don't create an immediate domain problem at or near c?\n- AI Tutor: Good careful thinking — these subtleties matter.\n\nShort answer: after you solve for parameters, you should do both kinds of checks:\n- Check the domains at x = c and for x arbitrarily close to c on each relevant side (so check denominators and other domain issues at and near the boundary).\n- Also flag any parameter values that invalidate simplifications because they make a factor zero (or otherwise change the algebraic validity) on a neighborhood of c, even if that zero doesn't occur exactly at c.\n\nWhy both are necessary:\n- Checking at and near c ensures the one-sided limits you computed actually exist for the original formulas and that f(c) (if the interval includes c) is truly defined and finite.\n- Flagging parameter values that make a canceled factor zero somewhere near c is necessary because cancellation is only valid for x values where that factor is nonzero. If your solved parameter causes the canceled factor to vanish for x values arbitrarily close to c (on the relevant side), the simplified expression you used to compute the limit might not correctly describe the original expression's behavior near c. That could change whether the limit exists or what its value is.\n\nPractical checklist to follow after solving for parameters:\n1. Substitute the parameter values into the original piecewise formulas.\n2. Check denominators and other domain restrictions:\n   - At x = c (if the interval includes c): evaluate the original formula to see whether f(c) is defined and finite.\n   - For x arbitrarily close to c on each side: check whether the expression is defined (no zero denominators, no invalid radicals, etc.). If everything is defined near c, the limit computed from the simplified form is valid.\n3. Identify any factors you cancelled when computing limits (explicitly note them), and check whether those factors become zero for the parameter values you found at any x values arbitrarily close to c on the side in question. If so, analyze that parameter case separately rather than trusting the simplified expression blindly.\n4. If a canceled factor is zero only exactly at c (and not for x near c), simplification is still valid for computing one-sided limits because limits exclude x = c; you then only need to check whether f(c) is defined.\n5. If a canceled factor is zero on an interval or at points approaching c, the simplification may be invalid for the limit — do the limit computation directly using the original form or handle the special parameter value separately.\n\nSo: yes, you must both check the usual domain-at-and-near-c conditions and explicitly flag special parameter values that change the validity of your algebraic cancellations. Doing both keeps your argument rigorous and avoids subtle mistakes.\n\nIf you want, give me a short example expression where you canceled a factor involving a parameter and we can step through these checks together.\n\n# Your Message Style\n## Interaction Style\n- Length of User Message: The user's query/response is always around 20 words.\n\n# Task\nGenerate your next message following these rules:\n1.

One quick follow-up: if the endpoint is included in a piecewise definition but the formula there is something like a fraction that becomes undefined at c (so f(c) isn't actually defined even though the inequality includes c), do we treat that the same as \"f(c) not defined\" and therefore say it's discontinuous unless the one-sided limit exists and we redefine f(c)? In other words, inclusion by the interval doesn't override the function being undefined at that point — right?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Right — inclusion by the interval does not override the actual formula failing to produce a value at that point. If the piece that \"contains\" c has a formula that is undefined at c (like a division by zero, a logarithm of a nonpositive number, etc.), then f(c) is not defined in practice, even if the interval symbol includes c. You should treat that the same as any other point where f(c) is not defined.\n\nSo you proceed this way:\n- First check whether the formula for the piece that supposedly defines f(c) actually yields a finite value at c. If it does, that is f(c).\n- If the formula is undefined at c, then f(c) is not defined (unless the problem explicitly states some defined value at c).\n- For continuity:\n  - If f(c) is defined, require the relevant one-sided limits equal f(c) (or both one-sided limits equal f(c) if c is an interior point).\n  - If f(c) is not defined, continuity at c would require the one-sided limits (the ones that make sense given the domain) to exist and be equal; then you could define f(c) to be that common limit to make the function continuous there. If the one-sided limits do not agree (or don't exist), the point is a discontinuity.\n\nExample to keep in mind: Suppose a piece is defined as (x^2 − 1)/(x − 1) for x ≤ 1. The algebraic expression is undefined at x = 1, even though the interval includes 1. You should note f(1) is not defined unless the definition separately specifies a value at 1. However, the one-sided limit (from the left) of that expression as x → 1− equals 2 (because the fraction simplifies to x+1 for x ≠ 1). So you could say the left-hand limit exists and equals 2, but f(1) is undefined — the function is not continuous at 1 unless you define f(1) = 2.\n\nWould you like to try a short example where the formula is undefined at the endpoint so you can apply these steps?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thanks — that clarification really helped. One quick question: when a formula is undefined at c but the one-sided limits both exist and are equal (a removable discontinuity), is it correct that we say the original function is discontinuous at c but can be made continuous by defining f(c) equal to that common limit? And in practice, when solving for unknown constants to enforce continuity across a boundary, I can treat f(c) as “not defined” initially and instead set the left- and right-hand expressions equal to each other (ignoring f(c)) to get the equation. Is that the right procedure every time in removable-discontinuity cases?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes — that's all correct. A few precise points to keep your understanding exact:\n\n- If the formula at c is undefined (so f(c) is not actually a value), then the function as written is discontinuous at c, even if both one-sided limits exist and are equal. That kind of discontinuity is called removable because you can \"remove\" it by defining f(c) to be the common limit.\n\n- In solving for unknown constants to enforce continuity at a boundary where the function currently has no defined value at c, the right procedure is exactly what you described: require the left-hand limit and right-hand limit to be equal. Concretely, pick the piece valid for x < c, evaluate its formula as x → c− (usually by direct substitution if it's a polynomial/rational expression that's defined at c), pick the piece valid for x > c and evaluate as x → c+, and set those two expressions equal. Solve for the unknown(s). After that, defining f(c) to be that common value yields a continuous function at c.\n\n- If f(c) is defined but the formula gives an indeterminate/undefined expression at c, treat f(c) as not defined (unless the problem explicitly gives a value) and follow the same approach above.\n\n- Small caution: when dealing with rational expressions that simplify to a continuous expression except at c, you can often simplify first (noting equivalence for x ≠ c) and then substitute the limit value; but remember that simplification doesn't retroactively define f(c). You still must check and (if required) specify f(c).\n\nWould you like to practice this with a short example where you solve for a constant that removes a discontinuity?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thanks — that cleared up my confusion about inclusion vs. actual definability at c. One more quick thing: when the left- and right-hand expressions are algebraically different but both simplify to the same value at c (for example one side simplifies after canceling a factor that’s zero at c), is it always safe to directly substitute c into each simplified form when forming the equation for continuity? Or should I keep the original unsimplified expressions and only simplify after equating them? Which is the more reliable step to avoid mistakes when solving for unknown constants?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Good question — being careful here avoids mistakes. Short answer: either approach can work, but you must keep track of where algebraic simplifications are valid. Here's a reliable procedure and the reason behind it:\n\n1. Identify which piece applies on each side of c (x < c and x > c). For each piece, consider the expression as defining the function for values not equal to c (i.e., in a neighborhood excluding c if necessary).\n\n2. For computing the one-sided limits, you may simplify each piece first (cancel factors, factor polynomials, etc.) as long as you remember that simplification is only valid for x values where the canceled factor is not zero. That is fine because one-sided limits look at x approaching c but not equaling c, so simplifications that are valid for x ≠ c are allowed when evaluating the limit.\n\n   - Example: if a piece is (x^2 − 1)/(x − 1) for x < 1, you can simplify to x + 1 for x ≠ 1 and then substitute x = 1 to get the left-hand limit 2.\n\n3. If you are forming algebraic equations to enforce continuity (i.e., setting left-hand limit = right-hand limit), it is safe and often simpler to simplify each expression first (valid for x ≠ c) and then substitute c to get the limit values to equate. This is the usual, reliable method when the simplifications do not depend on unknowns making denominators zero at c.\n\n4. Caution cases to watch for:\n   - If simplifying introduces division by an expression that might be zero for some values of the unknown constants, you must check those parameter values separately. For example, if simplification cancels a factor that contains the unknown constant, the cancellation might be invalid for certain constant values; always ensure the canceled factor is nonzero given the unknowns' values, or handle the special cases separately.\n   - If the original piece's formula truly fails to be defined at c (division by zero etc.), remember f(c) is still undefined unless explicitly given — simplification does not define f(c), it only gives the limit.\n\n5. Practical rule of thumb:\n   - Simplify each side (for x ≠ c), compute the one-sided limits by substituting c into the simplified forms, set those limits equal, and solve for unknowns.\n   - After solving, verify that your solution doesn't make any denominator (or other restricted expression) zero in the original formulas at values of x near c (which could invalidate the simplification step). If it does, handle that special case separately.\n\nWould you like to try a quick example where simplification cancels a factor so you can practice both the usual method and checking special cases?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thanks — that explanation helped me learn the nuance about cancellations depending on unknown constants. One quick confirmation: after I solve the equations produced by equating the one-sided limits (using simplified forms), the final extra check should be to substitute the found parameter values back into the original piecewise formulas and verify no denominator (or other undefined expression) is zero for x near the boundary — is that the complete post-solution check, or should I also explicitly test the original unsimplified expressions at the boundary point itself?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Good attention to detail — that's exactly the right idea, and you're mostly done with the checks. Here's a concise checklist of what to do after you solve for the parameters; follow these to be thorough and avoid subtle mistakes:\n\n1. Substitute the found parameter values into the original piecewise formulas.\n2. Check the one-sided limits near the boundary by substituting the boundary value into the simplified forms (these give the limits because simplification is valid for x ≠ c). Confirm they are equal (this should hold because you solved for that).\n3. Check the original (unsimplified) formulas for any expressions that are undefined at or near c:\n   - Verify no denominator becomes zero for x values arbitrarily close to c on the side where that piece is used.\n   - Verify there are no other domain issues (like logs of nonpositive numbers, square roots of negatives, etc.) for x near c.\n4. Check whether f(c) is actually defined in the piecewise definition:\n   - If the interval inclusion gives f(c) (≤ or ≥) and the substituted formula is defined at c, compute f(c) and verify it equals the common one-sided limit.\n   - If the piece's formula is undefined at c (even if the interval includes c), then f(c) is not defined; in that case the original function is still discontinuous at c until you explicitly define f(c) equal to the common limit. Note this does not contradict solving for parameters to make the limits equal — it only means you must define f(c) afterward to make the function continuous as written.\n5. If any parameter value you found makes a denominator zero (or otherwise causes the expression to be undefined) at x values arbitrarily close to c for the relevant side, you must treat that as a special case. Either:\n   - reject that parameter value if it prevents the required limit from existing, or\n   - analyze it separately to see whether the limit still exists (often it won't).\n\nIn short: yes — substitute parameter values back into the original formulas and check for undefined behavior near the boundary; additionally, explicitly check f(c) (if the interval includes c) to ensure it matches the one-sided limits. Those steps together constitute the complete post-solution check."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thanks — that checklist cleared up my last uncertainty. I understand now to (1) simplify to compute one-sided limits, (2) set them equal to solve for parameters, and then (3) substitute those parameter values back into the original unsimplified pieces to check for any domain issues and to confirm whether f(c) is actually defined and equals the common limit. One quick confirmation: if after substituting the parameters the original piece that supposedly defines f(c) is undefined at c, then I should report the function as discontinuous at c unless the problem explicitly tells me to redefine f(c). Is that the correct final takeaway?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes — that's the correct final takeaway.\n\nTo restate succinctly:\n- If the piecewise definition (after substituting solved parameters) gives a concrete finite value at c (the formula is defined there and the interval includes c), then continuity at c requires that value to equal the common one-sided limit.\n- If the piecewise definition does not actually produce a value at c (the formula is undefined at c, even if the interval symbol includes c), then as written the function is discontinuous at c. It can be made continuous only by explicitly defining f(c) to be the common one-sided limit (if that common limit exists).\n- If the one-sided limits themselves do not agree, the function has a nonremovable (jump) discontinuity at c and cannot be made continuous there by merely defining f(c).\n\nYou've got the right procedure and conclusion — well done."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thanks — that all clarified things for me. One thing I'd like to confirm about the post-solution checks: after I solve for parameters by equating one-sided limits and substitute them back, is it enough to check (a) the simplified limit values match, (b) no denominators or other domain problems occur for x near the boundary on the relevant sides, and (c) whether the piece that “includes” the endpoint actually evaluates to a finite number at the endpoint? Or should I also explicitly check the original unsimplified formula exactly at the endpoint even when the interval notation includes it (i.e., is checking (c) the same as checking the original formula at the endpoint)? I want to be sure I'm not skipping any distinct check."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You're asking for a precise checklist so you don't accidentally skip a distinct step — good thinking. Your three checks (a), (b), and (c) are essentially the correct and complete set, and checking (c) is exactly the same as evaluating the original (unsimplified) formula at the endpoint to see whether it yields a finite value. I'll restate them and point out why each is needed and how they differ (or not):\n\n1. Check the one-sided limits (usually using the simplified forms).\n   - This is (a). Simplifying is fine because limits look at x approaching c, not x = c, so canceling factors that are zero only at c is allowed.\n   - Purpose: ensures the left- and right-hand behavior match (or gives the common limit).\n\n2. Check for domain issues near the boundary on each relevant side.\n   - This is (b). After substituting the parameter values back into the original piecewise formulas, verify that for x values arbitrarily close to c (but on the correct side), the expression is defined (no zero denominators, no negative inside an even root, etc.).\n   - Purpose: ensures the limit you computed actually exists in the original formula (and that your simplification didn't hide a problem like division by an expression that could be zero for nearby x when parameters take certain values).\n\n3. Check whether the piece that is supposed to define f(c) actually produces a finite value at c.\n   - This is (c), and it is identical to evaluating the original (unsimplified) formula at x = c (provided the interval notation includes the endpoint). If the formula is undefined at c, then f(c) is not defined in the given function even if the notation suggests it is; you must report the function as discontinuous at c unless the problem allows redefining f(c).\n   - Purpose: ensures the function as written has an assigned value at c, and that that value equals the common one-sided limit (for actual continuity).\n\nSo no, you do not need an additional separate check beyond these three. In particular, \"checking (c)\" is the same thing as \"explicitly checking the original unsimplified formula exactly at the endpoint\" — because whether the formula is defined at c can only be determined by evaluating that original formula at c (after substituting parameter values). The only extra subtlety to remember is: if your simplification canceled a factor that depends on the parameters, make sure that cancellation was valid for the parameter values you found; if not, analyze that special parameter case separately.\n\nIf you'd like, I can give a very short example that walks through (a)–(c) to illustrate the steps concretely. Would you like that?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thanks — that explanation cleared up the subtle point for me. One quick clarifying question: after I solve for parameters by equating one-sided limits, is it enough to (1) substitute those parameters back into the original pieces and check for domain problems near the boundary and (2) explicitly evaluate the original unsimplified piece at the endpoint (to confirm f(c) is actually defined), or should I also separately flag any parameter values that make the canceled factor zero somewhere near c even if those values didn't make a denominator zero exactly at c? In other words, after substitution, do I only need to check denominators (and other domain issues) at x = c and arbitrarily close to c, or must I also list special parameter values that change the algebraic validity of prior simplifications even if they don't create an immediate domain problem at or near c?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Good careful thinking — these subtleties matter.\n\nShort answer: after you solve for parameters, you should do both kinds of checks:\n- Check the domains at x = c and for x arbitrarily close to c on each relevant side (so check denominators and other domain issues at and near the boundary).\n- Also flag any parameter values that invalidate simplifications because they make a factor zero (or otherwise change the algebraic validity) on a neighborhood of c, even if that zero doesn't occur exactly at c.\n\nWhy both are necessary:\n- Checking at and near c ensures the one-sided limits you computed actually exist for the original formulas and that f(c) (if the interval includes c) is truly defined and finite.\n- Flagging parameter values that make a canceled factor zero somewhere near c is necessary because cancellation is only valid for x values where that factor is nonzero. If your solved parameter causes the canceled factor to vanish for x values arbitrarily close to c (on the relevant side), the simplified expression you used to compute the limit might not correctly describe the original expression's behavior near c. That could change whether the limit exists or what its value is.\n\nPractical checklist to follow after solving for parameters:\n1. Substitute the parameter values into the original piecewise formulas.\n2. Check denominators and other domain restrictions:\n   - At x = c (if the interval includes c): evaluate the original formula to see whether f(c) is defined and finite.\n   - For x arbitrarily close to c on each side: check whether the expression is defined (no zero denominators, no invalid radicals, etc.). If everything is defined near c, the limit computed from the simplified form is valid.\n3. Identify any factors you cancelled when computing limits (explicitly note them), and check whether those factors become zero for the parameter values you found at any x values arbitrarily close to c on the side in question. If so, analyze that parameter case separately rather than trusting the simplified expression blindly.\n4. If a canceled factor is zero only exactly at c (and not for x near c), simplification is still valid for computing one-sided limits because limits exclude x = c; you then only need to check whether f(c) is defined.\n5. If a canceled factor is zero on an interval or at points approaching c, the simplification may be invalid for the limit — do the limit computation directly using the original form or handle the special parameter value separately.\n\nSo: yes, you must both check the usual domain-at-and-near-c conditions and explicitly flag special parameter values that change the validity of your algebraic cancellations. Doing both keeps your argument rigorous and avoids subtle mistakes.\n\nIf you want, give me a short example expression where you canceled a factor involving a parameter and we can step through these checks together."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Thanks — that explanation taught me something new (about flagging canceled factors that could vanish near the boundary).

If evidence is insufficient, keep the previous state.\n* Use prerequisite evidence: if prerequisites are not well understood, do not assign knows_well.\n* Do not invent concepts or evidence; rely only on the given inputs.\n\nBelow is the process you should follow while analyzing and updating:\n1. Check the user's previous understanding level of this concept.\n2. Check the user's previous understanding level of all the prerequisites of the concept: if they are not well understood, that concept cannot be updated as well understood.\n3. Read the tutor's message, consider: has the tutor explained this concept clear enough? How well can the user understand it through that explanation?\n4. Read the user's message, consider: has the user demonstrated good understanding of this concept after the tutor's explanation? Or did the user express further confusion?\n5. Combine all the information above to decide the new level for the concept.\n\nBelow are the rules you should follow when analyzing and updating:\n1. The understanding level can never be downgraded by you.\n2. Consider the prerequisites along with user's current understanding: if the prerequisites of one concept are not well understood, that concept cannot be updated as well understood.\n3. If the tutor did not explain a concept in this turn, keep its state unchanged.\n\n## Tutor's Explanation\nThat checklist is precise and complete for essentially all ordinary piecewise/limit problems — nothing important is missing. To restate succinctly and confirm:\n\n1. Substitute the solved parameter values into the original (unsimplified) piecewise formulas and check domain behavior for x arbitrarily close to c on each relevant side (no zero denominators, invalid radicals, log problems, etc.). This ensures the one-sided limits you computed actually exist for the original formulas.\n\n2. If the piecewise definition includes the endpoint (≤ or ≥), evaluate the original formula at x = c to confirm f(c) is defined and equals the common one-sided limit. If f(c) is undefined there, the function as written is discontinuous at c unless you explicitly redefine f(c).\n\n3. Make a list of any factors you cancelled when simplifying to compute limits and verify those factors are nonzero for x near c given your found parameter values. If any canceled factor can be zero for x arbitrarily close to c (on the relevant side), you must analyze that parameter case separately (because the simplification may have changed the function's behavior near c).\n\nA couple of minor practical reminders (optional):\n- If cancellation makes a factor zero only exactly at c (not for x near c), that's fine for computing the limit — limits exclude x = c — but you still must check f(c) separately (step 2).\n- If your solved parameters themselves make expressions undefined for all x in a side's neighborhood of c (so the side's limit doesn't exist), discard or treat that parameter as a special case.\n- After all checks, explicitly state the continuity conclusion (continuous, removable discontinuity that can be fixed by defining f(c), or nonremovable/jump discontinuity).\n\nYou're set — that procedure will keep your work correct and rigorous.
