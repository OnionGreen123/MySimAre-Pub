Given a question and its reference answer, extract an Information Unit (IU) Graph. An IU graph represents all the pieces of understanding a person needs to fully comprehend the answer to this question.

## What is an Information Unit (IU)?

An Information Unit is a self-contained piece of understanding that:
1. Can be independently assessed — you can determine whether someone &quot;gets it&quot; as a standalone unit
2. Can be explained in 2-4 sentences — not a single fact, not an entire topic
3. Has prerequisite relationships with other IUs — understanding some IUs requires first understanding others

IUs can represent any type of knowledge: factual, conceptual, procedural, or reasoning-based. Do NOT categorize them by type — just extract them as units of understanding.

## What are prerequisite edges?

A prerequisite edge from IU_A to IU_B means: &quot;To understand IU_B, you need to first understand IU_A.&quot;

Only include HARD prerequisites — where understanding B genuinely requires A. Do not include soft/optional relationships.

## Extraction Guidelines

1. **Granularity**: Each IU should be explainable in 2-4 sentences. If it takes only one sentence, it&#x27;s too fine-grained (merge with related IUs). If it takes a full paragraph+, it&#x27;s too coarse (split into sub-IUs).
2. **Coverage**: The IU graph should cover ALL knowledge needed to fully understand the answer. A person who understands every IU in the graph should be able to reconstruct the full answer.
3. **Prerequisite chains**: Look for knowledge that builds on other knowledge. The graph should have meaningful depth (not just a flat list of independent facts).
4. **Merging knowledge chains**: Complex questions often involve multiple independent knowledge areas that merge. Identify where separate chains of understanding converge.
5. **Target**: Aim for 10-30 IUs depending on question complexity. Simple questions may have 10-15, complex questions may have 20-30.

## Input

Question: Let \\[f(x) = \\left\\{
\\begin{array}{cl} ax+3, &amp;\\text{ if }x&gt;2, \\\\
x-5 &amp;\\text{ if } -2 \\le x \\le 2, \\\\
2x-b &amp;\\text{ if } x &lt;-2.
\\end{array}
\\right.\\]Find $a+b$ if the piecewise function is continuous (which means that its graph can be drawn without lifting your pencil from the paper).

Reference Answer: For the piecewise function to be continuous, the cases must &quot;meet&quot; at $2$ and $-2$. For example, $ax+3$ and $x-5$ must be equal when $x=2$. This implies $a(2)+3=2-5$, which we solve to get $2a=-6 \\Rightarrow a=-3$. Similarly, $x-5$ and $2x-b$ must be equal when $x=-2$. Substituting, we get $-2-5=2(-2)-b$, which implies $b=3$. So $a+b=-3+3=\\boxed{0}$.

## Output Format

Return a JSON object:
```json
{
  &quot;nodes&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;id&quot;: &quot;IU1&quot;,
      &quot;concept&quot;: &quot;&lt;short concept name&gt;&quot;,
      &quot;description&quot;: &quot;&lt;2-4 sentence explanation of this unit of understanding&gt;&quot;
    }
  ],
  &quot;edges&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;from&quot;: &quot;&lt;source IU id&gt;&quot;,
      &quot;to&quot;: &quot;&lt;target IU id&gt;&quot;,
      &quot;reason&quot;: &quot;&lt;brief explanation of why this prerequisite relationship exists&gt;&quot;
    }
  ]
}
```

Important:
- Every IU (except foundational ones) should have at least one incoming prerequisite edge
- There should be no cycles in the graph
- Root nodes (no incoming edges) are foundational concepts
- Leaf nodes (no outgoing edges) are synthesis-level understandings

Great question — focusing on the boundary points is exactly right. Continuity at a boundary point means the left-hand limit, the right-hand limit, and the function value at that point (when defined) all agree.

There are two boundary points here: x = 2 and x = −2.

1) At x = 2:
- For x &gt; 2 the relevant formula is f(x) = a x + 3 (the right-hand rule).
- For −2 ≤ x ≤ 2 the formula that applies at x = 2 is f(x) = x − 5 (this is the value and the left-hand rule because that piece includes x = 2).

Continuity at x = 2 requires the right-hand value (ax + 3 evaluated as x → 2⁺) to equal the value at 2 (x − 5 evaluated at x = 2). So set
a·2 + 3 = 2 − 5.

2) At x = −2:
- For −2 ≤ x ≤ 2 the formula that applies at x = −2 is f(x) = x − 5 (this is the right-hand value as x → −2⁺ and the value at −2).
- For x &lt; −2 the formula is f(x) = 2x − b (the left-hand rule).

Continuity at x = −2 requires the left-hand limit (2x − b as x → −2⁻) to equal the value at −2 (x − 5 evaluated at x = −2). So set
2·(−2) − b = (−2) − 5.

Those are the two equations you should use. Do you want to try solving them for a and b now?

# Conversation History
- You: How do I write the continuity equations at x = 2 and x = -2 for this piecewise function? Specifically, which expressions should be equated at each boundary and why?
- AI Tutor: Great question — focusing on the boundary points is exactly right. Continuity at a boundary point means the left-hand limit, the right-hand limit, and the function value at that point (when defined) all agree.

There are two boundary points here: x = 2 and x = −2.

1) At x = 2:
- For x &gt; 2 the relevant formula is f(x) = a x + 3 (the right-hand rule).
- For −2 ≤ x ≤ 2 the formula that applies at x = 2 is f(x) = x − 5 (this is the value and the left-hand rule because that piece includes x = 2).

Continuity at x = 2 requires the right-hand value (ax + 3 evaluated as x → 2⁺) to equal the value at 2 (x − 5 evaluated at x = 2). So set
a·2 + 3 = 2 − 5.

2) At x = −2:
- For −2 ≤ x ≤ 2 the formula that applies at x = −2 is f(x) = x − 5 (this is the right-hand value as x → −2⁺ and the value at −2).
- For x &lt; −2 the formula is f(x) = 2x − b (the left-hand rule).

Continuity at x = −2 requires the left-hand limit (2x − b as x → −2⁻) to equal the value at −2 (x − 5 evaluated at x = −2). So set
2·(−2) − b = (−2) − 5.

Those are the two equations you should use. Do you want to try solving them for a and b now?
- You: Thanks — that clarification helped. So the two continuity equations are:
1) 2a + 3 = 2 − 5
2) 2(−2) − b = (−2) − 5

Is that correct? If so I&#x27;ll solve them now.
- AI Tutor: Yes — those are the correct equations coming from continuity at x = 2 and x = −2.

Quick check of the arithmetic setup before you solve:
- At x = 2: right-hand expression a·2 + 3 equals the value from the middle piece evaluated at 2, which is 2 − 5.
- At x = −2: left-hand expression 2·(−2) − b equals the middle piece evaluated at −2, which is (−2) − 5.

Go ahead and solve each equation for a and b. Tell me what you get and I’ll check your work.
- You: I got a = −3 and b = 3. Does that look right?
- AI Tutor: Let&#x27;s check each equation with your solutions.

From the first equation: 2a + 3 = 2 − 5 = −3.
So 2a + 3 = −3 ⇒ 2a = −6 ⇒ a = −3. That matches your value.

From the second equation: 2(−2) − b = (−2) − 5 = −7.
So −4 − b = −7 ⇒ −b = −3 ⇒ b = 3. That also matches.

Both are correct. Do you want to verify continuity by plugging them back into the piecewise definition and checking the values at x = 2 and x = −2?
- You: Thanks — I understand now why we equate those specific expressions at each boundary. I&#x27;ll verify by substituting a = −3 and b = 3 into the pieces and checking that both sides give the same y-values at x = 2 and x = −2. Do you want me to show those substitutions step by step or just the final checks?

Continuity at x = 2 requires the right-hand value (ax + 3 evaluated as x → 2⁺) to equal the value at 2 (x − 5 evaluated at x = 2). So set

From the first equation: 2a + 3 = 2 − 5 = −3.
So 2a + 3 = −3 ⇒ 2a = −6 ⇒ a = −3. That matches your value.

From the second equation: 2(−2) − b = (−2) − 5 = −7.
So −4 − b = −7 ⇒ −b = −3 ⇒ b = 3. That also matches.

Both are correct. Do you want to verify continuity by plugging them back into the piecewise definition and checking the values at x = 2 and x = −2?

Continuity at a boundary means the value from the piece that approaches from the left, the value from the piece that approaches from the right, and the function&#x27;s value at that point (if defined) must all be equal, so at x=2 you set the right-piece (ax+3) equal to the middle-piece evaluated at 2 (2−5) and at x=−2 you set the left-piece (2x−b) equal to the middle-piece evaluated at −2 (−2−5).

Continuity at x = 2 requires the right-hand value (ax + 3 evaluated as x → 2⁺) to equal the value at 2 (x − 5 evaluated at x = 2). So set

2) At x = −2:

Continuity at x = −2 requires the left-hand limit (2x − b as x → −2⁻) to equal the value at −2 (x − 5 evaluated at x = −2). So set
2·(−2) − b = (−2) − 5.

- AI Tutor: Let&#x27;s check each equation with your solutions.

From the first equation: 2a + 3 = 2 − 5 = −3.
So 2a + 3 = −3 ⇒ 2a = −6 ⇒ a = −3. That matches your value.

From the second equation: 2(−2) − b = (−2) − 5 = −7.
So −4 − b = −7 ⇒ −b = −3 ⇒ b = 3. That also matches.

Both are correct. Do you want to verify continuity by plugging them back into the piecewise definition and checking the values at x = 2 and x = −2?
- You: Thanks — I understand now why we equate those specific expressions at each boundary. I&#x27;ll verify by substituting a = −3 and b = 3 into the pieces and checking that both sides give the same y-values at x = 2 and x = −2.

- You: How do I write the continuity equations at x = 2 and x = -2 for this piecewise function? Specifically, which expressions should be equated at each boundary and why?
- AI Tutor: Great question — focusing on the boundary points is exactly right. Continuity at a boundary point means the left-hand limit, the right-hand limit, and the function value at that point (when defined) all agree.

There are two boundary points here: x = 2 and x = −2.

1) At x = 2:
- For x &gt; 2 the relevant formula is f(x) = a x + 3 (the right-hand rule).
- For −2 ≤ x ≤ 2 the formula that applies at x = 2 is f(x) = x − 5 (this is the value and the left-hand rule because that piece includes x = 2).

Continuity at x = 2 requires the right-hand value (ax + 3 evaluated as x → 2⁺) to equal the value at 2 (x − 5 evaluated at x = 2). So set
a·2 + 3 = 2 − 5.

2) At x = −2:
- For −2 ≤ x ≤ 2 the formula that applies at x = −2 is f(x) = x − 5 (this is the right-hand value as x → −2⁺ and the value at −2).
- For x &lt; −2 the formula is f(x) = 2x − b (the left-hand rule).

Continuity at x = −2 requires the left-hand limit (2x − b as x → −2⁻) to equal the value at −2 (x − 5 evaluated at x = −2). So set
2·(−2) − b = (−2) − 5.

Those are the two equations you should use. Do you want to try solving them for a and b now?
- You: Thanks — that clarification helped. So the two continuity equations are:
1) 2a + 3 = 2 − 5
2) 2(−2) − b = (−2) − 5

Is that correct? If so I&#x27;ll solve them now.
- AI Tutor: Yes — those are the correct equations coming from continuity at x = 2 and x = −2.

Quick check of the arithmetic setup before you solve:
- At x = 2: right-hand expression a·2 + 3 equals the value from the middle piece evaluated at 2, which is 2 − 5.
- At x = −2: left-hand expression 2·(−2) − b equals the middle piece evaluated at −2, which is (−2) − 5.

Go ahead and solve each equation for a and b. Tell me what you get and I’ll check your work.
- You: I got a = −3 and b = 3. Does that look right?
- AI Tutor: Let&#x27;s check each equation with your solutions.

From the first equation: 2a + 3 = 2 − 5 = −3.
So 2a + 3 = −3 ⇒ 2a = −6 ⇒ a = −3. That matches your value.

From the second equation: 2(−2) − b = (−2) − 5 = −7.
So −4 − b = −7 ⇒ −b = −3 ⇒ b = 3. That also matches.

Both are correct. Do you want to verify continuity by plugging them back into the piecewise definition and checking the values at x = 2 and x = −2?
- You: Thanks — I understand now why we equate those specific expressions at each boundary. I&#x27;ll verify by substituting a = −3 and b = 3 into the pieces and checking that both sides give the same y-values at x = 2 and x = −2. Do you want me to show those substitutions step by step or just the final checks?
- AI Tutor: Either is fine — show whatever helps you feel confident. If you want to practice the substitution steps, go ahead and write them out; if you just want a quick confirmation, you can state the evaluated values. Which would you prefer?
- You: I&#x27;ll do the quick checks (final values) to confirm.

At x = 2:
- Middle piece gives 2 − 5 = −3.
- Right piece with a = −3 gives a·2 + 3 = (−3)·2 + 3 = −6 + 3 = −3.
They match.

At x = −2:
- Middle piece gives (−2) − 5 = −7.
- Left piece with b = 3 gives 2(−2) − b = −4 − 3 = −7.
They match.

Everything is continuous at both boundaries. Would you like me to write the substitutions out step-by-step instead?
- AI Tutor: Nice and correct — your quick checks show continuity at both boundaries.

No need to rewrite the full step-by-step unless you want the practice. You&#x27;re done with the problem: a = −3, b = 3, so a + b = 0 if you need that final sum.

Would you like a brief summary of why we equated those pieces at each boundary (one-sentence refresher), or are you ready to move on?
- You: A one-sentence refresher would be helpful — please give that short explanation of why we equate those particular expressions at each boundary.
- AI Tutor: Continuity at a boundary means the value from the piece that approaches from the left, the value from the piece that approaches from the right, and the function&#x27;s value at that point (if defined) must all be equal, so at x=2 you set the right-piece (ax+3) equal to the middle-piece evaluated at 2 (2−5) and at x=−2 you set the left-piece (2x−b) equal to the middle-piece evaluated at −2 (−2−5).
- You: Thanks — that one-sentence refresher helped me solidify the idea: at each boundary the formulas from the adjacent pieces must give the same y-value, so you set the expression from the side approaching the boundary equal to the formula that applies at the boundary point.
- AI Tutor: Exactly — well said. That description captures the idea of matching the adjacent-piece expressions so the graph has no jump at the boundary. If you&#x27;d like, we can practice one more example or extend this to ensure differentiability at the boundaries (which would require matching derivatives). Which would you prefer?

Good extension. For differentiability at a boundary point, the function must first be continuous there, and additionally the left-hand derivative and the right-hand derivative at that point must be equal.

Identify the formulas on each side and take derivatives (they&#x27;re linear, so derivatives are constant):

- For x &gt; 2: f(x) = ax + 3, so f&#x27;(x) = a for x &gt; 2 (right-hand derivative at x = 2 is a).
- For −2 ≤ x ≤ 2: f(x) = x − 5, so f&#x27;(x) = 1 for −2 &lt; x &lt; 2 (both left- and right-hand derivatives inside this interval are 1).
- For x &lt; −2: f(x) = 2x − b, so f&#x27;(x) = 2 for x &lt; −2 (left-hand derivative at x = −2 is 2).

Now impose equality of one-sided derivatives at each boundary:

- At x = 2: right-hand derivative (from ax + 3) must equal left-hand derivative (from x − 5). So set
  a = 1.

- At x = −2: left-hand derivative (from 2x − b) must equal right-hand derivative (from x − 5). So set
  2 = 1.

Observe what these give:

- The condition at x = 2 is a = 1 (an extra restriction on a).
- The condition at x = −2 would require 2 = 1, which is impossible.

So you cannot make the function differentiable at x = −2 no matter what b is; the one-sided slopes there are different constants (2 and 1), so differentiability fails at x = −2. Differentiability at x = 2 would be possible if you choose a = 1, provided you also satisfy continuity there.

If you want, you can combine these derivative conditions with the continuity equations to find values of a and b that make the function differentiable at x = 2 (and note that differentiability at x = −2 is impossible). Do you want to go through that?

# Conversation History
- You: How do I write the continuity equations at x = 2 and x = -2 for this piecewise function? Specifically, which expressions should be equated at each boundary and why?
- AI Tutor: Great question — focusing on the boundary points is exactly right. Continuity at a boundary point means the left-hand limit, the right-hand limit, and the function value at that point (when defined) all agree.

There are two boundary points here: x = 2 and x = −2.

1) At x = 2:
- For x &gt; 2 the relevant formula is f(x) = a x + 3 (the right-hand rule).
- For −2 ≤ x ≤ 2 the formula that applies at x = 2 is f(x) = x − 5 (this is the value and the left-hand rule because that piece includes x = 2).

Continuity at x = 2 requires the right-hand value (ax + 3 evaluated as x → 2⁺) to equal the value at 2 (x − 5 evaluated at x = 2). So set
a·2 + 3 = 2 − 5.

2) At x = −2:
- For −2 ≤ x ≤ 2 the formula that applies at x = −2 is f(x) = x − 5 (this is the right-hand value as x → −2⁺ and the value at −2).
- For x &lt; −2 the formula is f(x) = 2x − b (the left-hand rule).

Continuity at x = −2 requires the left-hand limit (2x − b as x → −2⁻) to equal the value at −2 (x − 5 evaluated at x = −2). So set
2·(−2) − b = (−2) − 5.

Those are the two equations you should use. Do you want to try solving them for a and b now?
- You: Thanks — that clarification helped. So the two continuity equations are:
1) 2a + 3 = 2 − 5
2) 2(−2) − b = (−2) − 5

Is that correct? If so I&#x27;ll solve them now.
- AI Tutor: Yes — those are the correct equations coming from continuity at x = 2 and x = −2.

Quick check of the arithmetic setup before you solve:
- At x = 2: right-hand expression a·2 + 3 equals the value from the middle piece evaluated at 2, which is 2 − 5.
- At x = −2: left-hand expression 2·(−2) − b equals the middle piece evaluated at −2, which is (−2) − 5.

Go ahead and solve each equation for a and b. Tell me what you get and I’ll check your work.
- You: I got a = −3 and b = 3. Does that look right?
- AI Tutor: Let&#x27;s check each equation with your solutions.

From the first equation: 2a + 3 = 2 − 5 = −3.
So 2a + 3 = −3 ⇒ 2a = −6 ⇒ a = −3. That matches your value.

From the second equation: 2(−2) − b = (−2) − 5 = −7.
So −4 − b = −7 ⇒ −b = −3 ⇒ b = 3. That also matches.

Both are correct. Do you want to verify continuity by plugging them back into the piecewise definition and checking the values at x = 2 and x = −2?
- You: Thanks — I understand now why we equate those specific expressions at each boundary. I&#x27;ll verify by substituting a = −3 and b = 3 into the pieces and checking that both sides give the same y-values at x = 2 and x = −2. Do you want me to show those substitutions step by step or just the final checks?
- AI Tutor: Either is fine — show whatever helps you feel confident. If you want to practice the substitution steps, go ahead and write them out; if you just want a quick confirmation, you can state the evaluated values. Which would you prefer?
- You: I&#x27;ll do the quick checks (final values) to confirm.

At x = 2:
- Middle piece gives 2 − 5 = −3.
- Right piece with a = −3 gives a·2 + 3 = (−3)·2 + 3 = −6 + 3 = −3.
They match.

At x = −2:
- Middle piece gives (−2) − 5 = −7.
- Left piece with b = 3 gives 2(−2) − b = −4 − 3 = −7.
They match.

Everything is continuous at both boundaries. Would you like me to write the substitutions out step-by-step instead?
- AI Tutor: Nice and correct — your quick checks show continuity at both boundaries.

No need to rewrite the full step-by-step unless you want the practice. You&#x27;re done with the problem: a = −3, b = 3, so a + b = 0 if you need that final sum.

Would you like a brief summary of why we equated those pieces at each boundary (one-sentence refresher), or are you ready to move on?
- You: A one-sentence refresher would be helpful — please give that short explanation of why we equate those particular expressions at each boundary.
- AI Tutor: Continuity at a boundary means the value from the piece that approaches from the left, the value from the piece that approaches from the right, and the function&#x27;s value at that point (if defined) must all be equal, so at x=2 you set the right-piece (ax+3) equal to the middle-piece evaluated at 2 (2−5) and at x=−2 you set the left-piece (2x−b) equal to the middle-piece evaluated at −2 (−2−5).
- You: Thanks — that one-sentence refresher helped me solidify the idea: at each boundary the formulas from the adjacent pieces must give the same y-value, so you set the expression from the side approaching the boundary equal to the formula that applies at the boundary point.
- AI Tutor: Exactly — well said. That description captures the idea of matching the adjacent-piece expressions so the graph has no jump at the boundary. If you&#x27;d like, we can practice one more example or extend this to ensure differentiability at the boundaries (which would require matching derivatives). Which would you prefer?
- You: I’m comfortable with continuity and the checks we did. I’d like to extend this to differentiability at the boundaries — could you show exactly which derivative expressions to equate at x = 2 and x = −2 for this piecewise function and how that would give extra conditions on a and b?
- AI Tutor: Good extension. For differentiability at a boundary point, the function must first be continuous there, and additionally the left-hand derivative and the right-hand derivative at that point must be equal.

Identify the formulas on each side and take derivatives (they&#x27;re linear, so derivatives are constant):

- For x &gt; 2: f(x) = ax + 3, so f&#x27;(x) = a for x &gt; 2 (right-hand derivative at x = 2 is a).
- For −2 ≤ x ≤ 2: f(x) = x − 5, so f&#x27;(x) = 1 for −2 &lt; x &lt; 2 (both left- and right-hand derivatives inside this interval are 1).
- For x &lt; −2: f(x) = 2x − b, so f&#x27;(x) = 2 for x &lt; −2 (left-hand derivative at x = −2 is 2).

Now impose equality of one-sided derivatives at each boundary:

- At x = 2: right-hand derivative (from ax + 3) must equal left-hand derivative (from x − 5). So set
  a = 1.

- At x = −2: left-hand derivative (from 2x − b) must equal right-hand derivative (from x − 5). So set
  2 = 1.

Observe what these give:

- The condition at x = 2 is a = 1 (an extra restriction on a).
- The condition at x = −2 would require 2 = 1, which is impossible.

So you cannot make the function differentiable at x = −2 no matter what b is; the one-sided slopes there are different constants (2 and 1), so differentiability fails at x = −2. Differentiability at x = 2 would be possible if you choose a = 1, provided you also satisfy continuity there.

If you want, you can combine these derivative conditions with the continuity equations to find values of a and b that make the function differentiable at x = 2 (and note that differentiability at x = −2 is impossible). Do you want to go through that?
- You: Thanks — that explanation helped me learn that differentiability requires both continuity and equal one-sided slopes. I now understand that differentiability at x = −2 is impossible because the left slope is 2 and the right slope is 1, so no choice of b fixes it; and at x = 2 the derivative condition is a = 1, which I should pair with the continuity equation 2a+3 = −3 to solve for a. Would you like me to carry out that combined check for differentiability at x = 2?
- AI Tutor: Yes — please do the combined check. Reminder of the two things you need at x = 2 for differentiability:
- continuity: 2a + 3 = (value of middle piece at 2) = 2 − 5 = −3,
- equal one-sided derivatives: a (right-side slope) = 1 (middle-piece slope).

Use those two conditions together to see whether a single a satisfies both. Tell me what you get and I’ll confirm.

Exactly — that&#x27;s correct reasoning. You correctly used both conditions and found a contradiction (a would have to be −3 from continuity but 1 from matching derivatives), so no choice of a makes the function differentiable at x = 2. 

Summary:
- Continuity at x = 2 forces a = −3.
- Differentiability at x = 2 would additionally force a = 1.
- Because those conflict, differentiability at x = 2 is impossible.
- And as you noted earlier, differentiability at x = −2 is also impossible because the one-sided slopes are 2 and 1, which can&#x27;t be matched by any b.

Nice work checking both continuity and derivative conditions. Would you like a brief example of a piecewise function that is both continuous and differentiable at its boundary, for comparison?

# Conversation History
- You: How do I write the continuity equations at x = 2 and x = -2 for this piecewise function? Specifically, which expressions should be equated at each boundary and why?
- AI Tutor: Great question — focusing on the boundary points is exactly right. Continuity at a boundary point means the left-hand limit, the right-hand limit, and the function value at that point (when defined) all agree.

There are two boundary points here: x = 2 and x = −2.

1) At x = 2:
- For x &gt; 2 the relevant formula is f(x) = a x + 3 (the right-hand rule).
- For −2 ≤ x ≤ 2 the formula that applies at x = 2 is f(x) = x − 5 (this is the value and the left-hand rule because that piece includes x = 2).

Continuity at x = 2 requires the right-hand value (ax + 3 evaluated as x → 2⁺) to equal the value at 2 (x − 5 evaluated at x = 2). So set
a·2 + 3 = 2 − 5.

2) At x = −2:
- For −2 ≤ x ≤ 2 the formula that applies at x = −2 is f(x) = x − 5 (this is the right-hand value as x → −2⁺ and the value at −2).
- For x &lt; −2 the formula is f(x) = 2x − b (the left-hand rule).

Continuity at x = −2 requires the left-hand limit (2x − b as x → −2⁻) to equal the value at −2 (x − 5 evaluated at x = −2). So set
2·(−2) − b = (−2) − 5.

Those are the two equations you should use. Do you want to try solving them for a and b now?
- You: Thanks — that clarification helped. So the two continuity equations are:
1) 2a + 3 = 2 − 5
2) 2(−2) − b = (−2) − 5

Is that correct? If so I&#x27;ll solve them now.
- AI Tutor: Yes — those are the correct equations coming from continuity at x = 2 and x = −2.

Quick check of the arithmetic setup before you solve:
- At x = 2: right-hand expression a·2 + 3 equals the value from the middle piece evaluated at 2, which is 2 − 5.
- At x = −2: left-hand expression 2·(−2) − b equals the middle piece evaluated at −2, which is (−2) − 5.

Go ahead and solve each equation for a and b. Tell me what you get and I’ll check your work.
- You: I got a = −3 and b = 3. Does that look right?
- AI Tutor: Let&#x27;s check each equation with your solutions.

From the first equation: 2a + 3 = 2 − 5 = −3.
So 2a + 3 = −3 ⇒ 2a = −6 ⇒ a = −3. That matches your value.

From the second equation: 2(−2) − b = (−2) − 5 = −7.
So −4 − b = −7 ⇒ −b = −3 ⇒ b = 3. That also matches.

Both are correct. Do you want to verify continuity by plugging them back into the piecewise definition and checking the values at x = 2 and x = −2?
- You: Thanks — I understand now why we equate those specific expressions at each boundary. I&#x27;ll verify by substituting a = −3 and b = 3 into the pieces and checking that both sides give the same y-values at x = 2 and x = −2. Do you want me to show those substitutions step by step or just the final checks?
- AI Tutor: Either is fine — show whatever helps you feel confident. If you want to practice the substitution steps, go ahead and write them out; if you just want a quick confirmation, you can state the evaluated values. Which would you prefer?
- You: I&#x27;ll do the quick checks (final values) to confirm.

At x = 2:
- Middle piece gives 2 − 5 = −3.
- Right piece with a = −3 gives a·2 + 3 = (−3)·2 + 3 = −6 + 3 = −3.
They match.

At x = −2:
- Middle piece gives (−2) − 5 = −7.
- Left piece with b = 3 gives 2(−2) − b = −4 − 3 = −7.
They match.

Everything is continuous at both boundaries. Would you like me to write the substitutions out step-by-step instead?

Sure — here&#x27;s a short example you can compare directly.

Define
g(x) = { mx + c, if x ≥ 0
         kx^2 + d, if x &lt; 0 }.

We want g to be continuous and differentiable at x = 0.

Continuity at 0: value from right (mx + c evaluated at 0) must equal value from left (kx^2 + d at 0). That gives
c = d.

Differentiability at 0: right-hand derivative is m (derivative of mx + c), left-hand derivative is 0 (derivative of kx^2 at 0 is 2kx, which equals 0 at x = 0). Set them equal:
m = 0.

Combining: m = 0 and c = d. For example choose m = 0, k = 1, c = d = 2. Then
g(x) = { 0·x + 2 = 2, if x ≥ 0
         x^2 + 2, if x &lt; 0 }
is continuous at 0 (both sides give 2 at x = 0) and differentiable at 0 (both one-sided derivatives equal 0).

Compare this with your earlier problem:
- You matched adjacent function values at the boundary for continuity (like c = d).
- For differentiability you matched one-sided slopes; in your problem those slopes were constants that could not be made equal simultaneously, whereas in this example they can (m = 0 = left slope at 0).

Would you like another example where both pieces are linear (so matching slopes is just setting the two constants equal) or one where both sides are nonlinear?

- For −2 ≤ x ≤ 2 the formula that applies at x = 2 is f(x) = x − 5 (this is the value and the left-hand rule because that piece includes x = 2).

Continuity at x = 2 requires the right-hand value (ax + 3 evaluated as x → 2⁺) to equal the value at 2 (x − 5 evaluated at x = 2). So set
a·2 + 3 = 2 − 5.

2) At x = −2:
- For −2 ≤ x ≤ 2 the formula that applies at x = −2 is f(x) = x − 5 (this is the right-hand value as x → −2⁺ and the value at −2).
- For x &lt; −2 the formula is f(x) = 2x − b (the left-hand rule).

Continuity at x = −2 requires the left-hand limit (2x − b as x → −2⁻) to equal the value at −2 (x − 5 evaluated at x = −2). So set
2·(−2) − b = (−2) − 5.

Those are the two equations you should use. Do you want to try solving them for a and b now?
- You: Thanks — that clarification helped. So the two continuity equations are:
1) 2a + 3 = 2 − 5
2) 2(−2) − b = (−2) − 5

Is that correct? If so I&#x27;ll solve them now.
- AI Tutor: Yes — those are the correct equations coming from continuity at x = 2 and x = −2.

Quick check of the arithmetic setup before you solve:
- At x = 2: right-hand expression a·2 + 3 equals the value from the middle piece evaluated at 2, which is 2 − 5.
- At x = −2: left-hand expression 2·(−2) − b equals the middle piece evaluated at −2, which is (−2) − 5.

Go ahead and solve each equation for a and b. Tell me what you get and I’ll check your work.
- You: I got a = −3 and b = 3. Does that look right?
- AI Tutor: Let&#x27;s check each equation with your solutions.

From the first equation: 2a + 3 = 2 − 5 = −3.
So 2a + 3 = −3 ⇒ 2a = −6 ⇒ a = −3. That matches your value.

From the second equation: 2(−2) − b = (−2) − 5 = −7.
So −4 − b = −7 ⇒ −b = −3 ⇒ b = 3. That also matches.

Both are correct. Do you want to verify continuity by plugging them back into the piecewise definition and checking the values at x = 2 and x = −2?
- You: Thanks — I understand now why we equate those specific expressions at each boundary. I&#x27;ll verify by substituting a = −3 and b = 3 into the pieces and checking that both sides give the same y-values at x = 2 and x = −2.

At x = 2:

- Right piece with a = −3 gives a·2 + 3 = (−3)·2 + 3 = −6 + 3 = −3.
They match.

At x = −2:
- Middle piece gives (−2) − 5 = −7.
- Left piece with b = 3 gives 2(−2) − b = −4 − 3 = −7.
They match.

Everything is continuous at both boundaries. Would you like me to write the substitutions out step-by-step instead?
- AI Tutor: Nice and correct — your quick checks show continuity at both boundaries.

No need to rewrite the full step-by-step unless you want the practice. You&#x27;re done with the problem: a = −3, b = 3, so a + b = 0 if you need that final sum.

Would you like a brief summary of why we equated those pieces at each boundary (one-sentence refresher), or are you ready to move on?
- You: A one-sentence refresher would be helpful — please give that short explanation of why we equate those particular expressions at each boundary.
- AI Tutor: Continuity at a boundary means the value from the piece that approaches from the left, the value from the piece that approaches from the right, and the function&#x27;s value at that point (if defined) must all be equal, so at x=2 you set the right-piece (ax+3) equal to the middle-piece evaluated at 2 (2−5) and at x=−2 you set the left-piece (2x−b) equal to the middle-piece evaluated at −2 (−2−5).
- You: Thanks — that one-sentence refresher helped me solidify the idea: at each boundary the formulas from the adjacent pieces must give the same y-value, so you set the expression from the side approaching the boundary equal to the formula that applies at the boundary point.
- AI Tutor: Exactly — well said. That description captures the idea of matching the adjacent-piece expressions so the graph has no jump at the boundary. If you&#x27;d like, we can practice one more example or extend this to ensure differentiability at the boundaries (which would require matching derivatives). Which would you prefer?
- You: I’m comfortable with continuity and the checks we did. I’d like to extend this to differentiability at the boundaries — could you show exactly which derivative expressions to equate at x = 2 and x = −2 for this piecewise function and how that would give extra conditions on a and b?
- AI Tutor: Good extension. For differentiability at a boundary point, the function must first be continuous there, and additionally the left-hand derivative and the right-hand derivative at that point must be equal.

Identify the formulas on each side and take derivatives (they&#x27;re linear, so derivatives are constant):

- For x &gt; 2: f(x) = ax + 3, so f&#x27;(x) = a for x &gt; 2 (right-hand derivative at x = 2 is a).
- For −2 ≤ x ≤ 2: f(x) = x − 5, so f&#x27;(x) = 1 for −2 &lt; x &lt; 2 (both left- and right-hand derivatives inside this interval are 1).
- For x &lt; −2: f(x) = 2x − b, so f&#x27;(x) = 2 for x &lt; −2 (left-hand derivative at x = −2 is 2).

Now impose equality of one-sided derivatives at each boundary:

- At x = 2: right-hand derivative (from ax + 3) must equal left-hand derivative (from x − 5). So set
  a = 1.

- At x = −2: left-hand derivative (from 2x − b) must equal right-hand derivative (from x − 5). So set
  2 = 1.

Observe what these give:

- The condition at x = 2 is a = 1 (an extra restriction on a).
- The condition at x = −2 would require 2 = 1, which is impossible.

So you cannot make the function differentiable at x = −2 no matter what b is; the one-sided slopes there are different constants (2 and 1), so differentiability fails at x = −2. Differentiability at x = 2 would be possible if you choose a = 1, provided you also satisfy continuity there.

If you want, you can combine these derivative conditions with the continuity equations to find values of a and b that make the function differentiable at x = 2 (and note that differentiability at x = −2 is impossible). Do you want to go through that?
- You: Thanks — that explanation helped me learn that differentiability requires both continuity and equal one-sided slopes. I now understand that differentiability at x = −2 is impossible because the left slope is 2 and the right slope is 1, so no choice of b fixes it; and at x = 2 the derivative condition is a = 1, which I should pair with the continuity equation 2a+3 = −3 to solve for a. Would you like me to carry out that combined check for differentiability at x = 2?
- AI Tutor: Yes — please do the combined check. Reminder of the two things you need at x = 2 for differentiability:
- continuity: 2a + 3 = (value of middle piece at 2) = 2 − 5 = −3,
- equal one-sided derivatives: a (right-side slope) = 1 (middle-piece slope).

Use those two conditions together to see whether a single a satisfies both. Tell me what you get and I’ll confirm.
- You: Combining the two conditions: continuity gives 2a + 3 = −3 ⇒ a = −3, while the derivative condition requires a = 1. Since −3 ≠ 1, there is no a that satisfies both, so the function cannot be made differentiable at x = 2.
- AI Tutor: Exactly — that&#x27;s correct reasoning. You correctly used both conditions and found a contradiction (a would have to be −3 from continuity but 1 from matching derivatives), so no choice of a makes the function differentiable at x = 2. 

Summary:
- Continuity at x = 2 forces a = −3.
- Differentiability at x = 2 would additionally force a = 1.
- Because those conflict, differentiability at x = 2 is impossible.
- And as you noted earlier, differentiability at x = −2 is also impossible because the one-sided slopes are 2 and 1, which can&#x27;t be matched by any b.

Nice work checking both continuity and derivative conditions. Would you like a brief example of a piecewise function that is both continuous and differentiable at its boundary, for comparison?
- You: Thanks — that clarification helped me learn how to pair continuity and derivative conditions. I’m clear now that no choice of a or b makes the function differentiable at either boundary. Could you show one short example of a piecewise function that is both continuous and differentiable at its boundary so I can compare the conditions directly?
- AI Tutor: Sure — here&#x27;s a short example you can compare directly.

Define
g(x) = { mx + c, if x ≥ 0
         kx^2 + d, if x &lt; 0 }.

We want g to be continuous and differentiable at x = 0.

Continuity at 0: value from right (mx + c evaluated at 0) must equal value from left (kx^2 + d at 0). That gives
c = d.

Differentiability at 0: right-hand derivative is m (derivative of mx + c), left-hand derivative is 0 (derivative of kx^2 at 0 is 2kx, which equals 0 at x = 0). Set them equal:
m = 0.

Combining: m = 0 and c = d. For example choose m = 0, k = 1, c = d = 2. Then
g(x) = { 0·x + 2 = 2, if x ≥ 0
         x^2 + 2, if x &lt; 0 }
is continuous at 0 (both sides give 2 at x = 0) and differentiable at 0 (both one-sided derivatives equal 0).

Compare this with your earlier problem:
- You matched adjacent function values at the boundary for continuity (like c = d).
- For differentiability you matched one-sided slopes; in your problem those slopes were constants that could not be made equal simultaneously, whereas in this example they can (m = 0 = left slope at 0).

Would you like another example where both pieces are linear (so matching slopes is just setting the two constants equal) or one where both sides are nonlinear?

Good question — you&#x27;re thinking carefully about edge cases, which is important.

Short answer: Yes — once continuity at the point is established, differentiability at that point is equivalent to the left-hand derivative and right-hand derivative both existing and being equal. In practice that means you must:

- Check the function is continuous at the point.
- Compute the left-hand derivative (limit of the difference quotient as x→c−) and the right-hand derivative (limit as x→c+).
- Verify both one-sided derivatives exist (are finite) and are equal.

Caveats / edge cases to watch for:
- If one or both one-sided derivatives do not exist (e.g., vertical tangent, cusp, oscillation), then the function is not differentiable even if values match. So you must verify the limits exist, not just formally equate algebraic derivatives.
- If a piece is defined by a formula whose derivative is not the usual derivative everywhere (for example, piecewise-defined with absolute value, or involving nondifferentiable operations), compute the one-sided limit of the difference quotient rather than relying blindly on a symbolic derivative.
- If a piece&#x27;s derivative at the boundary exists only in a generalized sense (e.g., distributional derivative), that does not count for ordinary differentiability.
- If a piece is defined only by values (not a formula), you still must check the difference quotient limits directly.

Examples:
- Cusp: f(x)=|x| is continuous at 0, left derivative = −1, right derivative = 1, so not differentiable (one-sided derivatives exist but are unequal).
- Vertical tangent: f(x)=x^(1/3) has both one-sided derivatives → ±∞? Actually derivative at 0 is infinite slope? For x^(1/3), derivative at 0 is infinite? Correction: x^(1/3) has derivative ∞? The derivative of x^(1/3) at 0 is infinite? Better avoid specifics here — main point: if a one-sided derivative is infinite, it fails differentiability.

So in summary: equating one-sided derivatives is the correct test, provided you first check continuity and also confirm those one-sided derivative limits actually exist (finite). Would you like to try a quick example where one side has a cusp so we practice checking existence of one-sided derivatives?

# Conversation History
- You: How do I write the continuity equations at x = 2 and x = -2 for this piecewise function? Specifically, which expressions should be equated at each boundary and why?
- AI Tutor: Great question — focusing on the boundary points is exactly right. Continuity at a boundary point means the left-hand limit, the right-hand limit, and the function value at that point (when defined) all agree.

There are two boundary points here: x = 2 and x = −2.

1) At x = 2:
- For x &gt; 2 the relevant formula is f(x) = a x + 3 (the right-hand rule).
- For −2 ≤ x ≤ 2 the formula that applies at x = 2 is f(x) = x − 5 (this is the value and the left-hand rule because that piece includes x = 2).

Continuity at x = 2 requires the right-hand value (ax + 3 evaluated as x → 2⁺) to equal the value at 2 (x − 5 evaluated at x = 2). So set
a·2 + 3 = 2 − 5.

2) At x = −2:
- For −2 ≤ x ≤ 2 the formula that applies at x = −2 is f(x) = x − 5 (this is the right-hand value as x → −2⁺ and the value at −2).
- For x &lt; −2 the formula is f(x) = 2x − b (the left-hand rule).

Continuity at x = −2 requires the left-hand limit (2x − b as x → −2⁻) to equal the value at −2 (x − 5 evaluated at x = −2). So set
2·(−2) − b = (−2) − 5.

Those are the two equations you should use. Do you want to try solving them for a and b now?
- You: Thanks — that clarification helped. So the two continuity equations are:
1) 2a + 3 = 2 − 5
2) 2(−2) − b = (−2) − 5

Is that correct? If so I&#x27;ll solve them now.
- AI Tutor: Yes — those are the correct equations coming from continuity at x = 2 and x = −2.

Quick check of the arithmetic setup before you solve:
- At x = 2: right-hand expression a·2 + 3 equals the value from the middle piece evaluated at 2, which is 2 − 5.
- At x = −2: left-hand expression 2·(−2) − b equals the middle piece evaluated at −2, which is (−2) − 5.

Go ahead and solve each equation for a and b. Tell me what you get and I’ll check your work.
- You: I got a = −3 and b = 3. Does that look right?
- AI Tutor: Let&#x27;s check each equation with your solutions.

From the first equation: 2a + 3 = 2 − 5 = −3.
So 2a + 3 = −3 ⇒ 2a = −6 ⇒ a = −3. That matches your value.

From the second equation: 2(−2) − b = (−2) − 5 = −7.
So −4 − b = −7 ⇒ −b = −3 ⇒ b = 3. That also matches.

Both are correct. Do you want to verify continuity by plugging them back into the piecewise definition and checking the values at x = 2 and x = −2?
- You: Thanks — I understand now why we equate those specific expressions at each boundary. I&#x27;ll verify by substituting a = −3 and b = 3 into the pieces and checking that both sides give the same y-values at x = 2 and x = −2. Do you want me to show those substitutions step by step or just the final checks?
- AI Tutor: Either is fine — show whatever helps you feel confident. If you want to practice the substitution steps, go ahead and write them out; if you just want a quick confirmation, you can state the evaluated values. Which would you prefer?
- You: I&#x27;ll do the quick checks (final values) to confirm.

At x = 2:
- Middle piece gives 2 − 5 = −3.
- Right piece with a = −3 gives a·2 + 3 = (−3)·2 + 3 = −6 + 3 = −3.
They match.

At x = −2:
- Middle piece gives (−2) − 5 = −7.
- Left piece with b = 3 gives 2(−2) − b = −4 − 3 = −7.
They match.

Everything is continuous at both boundaries. Would you like me to write the substitutions out step-by-step instead?
- AI Tutor: Nice and correct — your quick checks show continuity at both boundaries.

No need to rewrite the full step-by-step unless you want the practice. You&#x27;re done with the problem: a = −3, b = 3, so a + b = 0 if you need that final sum.

Would you like a brief summary of why we equated those pieces at each boundary (one-sentence refresher), or are you ready to move on?
- You: A one-sentence refresher would be helpful — please give that short explanation of why we equate those particular expressions at each boundary.
- AI Tutor: Continuity at a boundary means the value from the piece that approaches from the left, the value from the piece that approaches from the right, and the function&#x27;s value at that point (if defined) must all be equal, so at x=2 you set the right-piece (ax+3) equal to the middle-piece evaluated at 2 (2−5) and at x=−2 you set the left-piece (2x−b) equal to the middle-piece evaluated at −2 (−2−5).
- You: Thanks — that one-sentence refresher helped me solidify the idea: at each boundary the formulas from the adjacent pieces must give the same y-value, so you set the expression from the side approaching the boundary equal to the formula that applies at the boundary point.
- AI Tutor: Exactly — well said. That description captures the idea of matching the adjacent-piece expressions so the graph has no jump at the boundary. If you&#x27;d like, we can practice one more example or extend this to ensure differentiability at the boundaries (which would require matching derivatives). Which would you prefer?
- You: I’m comfortable with continuity and the checks we did. I’d like to extend this to differentiability at the boundaries — could you show exactly which derivative expressions to equate at x = 2 and x = −2 for this piecewise function and how that would give extra conditions on a and b?
- AI Tutor: Good extension. For differentiability at a boundary point, the function must first be continuous there, and additionally the left-hand derivative and the right-hand derivative at that point must be equal.

Identify the formulas on each side and take derivatives (they&#x27;re linear, so derivatives are constant):

- For x &gt; 2: f(x) = ax + 3, so f&#x27;(x) = a for x &gt; 2 (right-hand derivative at x = 2 is a).
- For −2 ≤ x ≤ 2: f(x) = x − 5, so f&#x27;(x) = 1 for −2 &lt; x &lt; 2 (both left- and right-hand derivatives inside this interval are 1).
- For x &lt; −2: f(x) = 2x − b, so f&#x27;(x) = 2 for x &lt; −2 (left-hand derivative at x = −2 is 2).

Now impose equality of one-sided derivatives at each boundary:

- At x = 2: right-hand derivative (from ax + 3) must equal left-hand derivative (from x − 5). So set
  a = 1.

- At x = −2: left-hand derivative (from 2x − b) must equal right-hand derivative (from x − 5). So set
  2 = 1.

Observe what these give:

- The condition at x = 2 is a = 1 (an extra restriction on a).
- The condition at x = −2 would require 2 = 1, which is impossible.

So you cannot make the function differentiable at x = −2 no matter what b is; the one-sided slopes there are different constants (2 and 1), so differentiability fails at x = −2. Differentiability at x = 2 would be possible if you choose a = 1, provided you also satisfy continuity there.

If you want, you can combine these derivative conditions with the continuity equations to find values of a and b that make the function differentiable at x = 2 (and note that differentiability at x = −2 is impossible). Do you want to go through that?
- You: Thanks — that explanation helped me learn that differentiability requires both continuity and equal one-sided slopes. I now understand that differentiability at x = −2 is impossible because the left slope is 2 and the right slope is 1, so no choice of b fixes it; and at x = 2 the derivative condition is a = 1, which I should pair with the continuity equation 2a+3 = −3 to solve for a. Would you like me to carry out that combined check for differentiability at x = 2?
- AI Tutor: Yes — please do the combined check. Reminder of the two things you need at x = 2 for differentiability:
- continuity: 2a + 3 = (value of middle piece at 2) = 2 − 5 = −3,
- equal one-sided derivatives: a (right-side slope) = 1 (middle-piece slope).

Use those two conditions together to see whether a single a satisfies both. Tell me what you get and I’ll confirm.
- You: Combining the two conditions: continuity gives 2a + 3 = −3 ⇒ a = −3, while the derivative condition requires a = 1. Since −3 ≠ 1, there is no a that satisfies both, so the function cannot be made differentiable at x = 2.
- AI Tutor: Exactly — that&#x27;s correct reasoning. You correctly used both conditions and found a contradiction (a would have to be −3 from continuity but 1 from matching derivatives), so no choice of a makes the function differentiable at x = 2. 

Summary:
- Continuity at x = 2 forces a = −3.
- Differentiability at x = 2 would additionally force a = 1.
- Because those conflict, differentiability at x = 2 is impossible.
- And as you noted earlier, differentiability at x = −2 is also impossible because the one-sided slopes are 2 and 1, which can&#x27;t be matched by any b.

Nice work checking both continuity and derivative conditions. Would you like a brief example of a piecewise function that is both continuous and differentiable at its boundary, for comparison?
- You: Thanks — that clarification helped me learn how to pair continuity and derivative conditions. I’m clear now that no choice of a or b makes the function differentiable at either boundary. Could you show one short example of a piecewise function that is both continuous and differentiable at its boundary so I can compare the conditions directly?
- AI Tutor: Sure — here&#x27;s a short example you can compare directly.

Define
g(x) = { mx + c, if x ≥ 0
         kx^2 + d, if x &lt; 0 }.

We want g to be continuous and differentiable at x = 0.

Continuity at 0: value from right (mx + c evaluated at 0) must equal value from left (kx^2 + d at 0). That gives
c = d.

Differentiability at 0: right-hand derivative is m (derivative of mx + c), left-hand derivative is 0 (derivative of kx^2 at 0 is 2kx, which equals 0 at x = 0). Set them equal:
m = 0.

Combining: m = 0 and c = d. For example choose m = 0, k = 1, c = d = 2. Then
g(x) = { 0·x + 2 = 2, if x ≥ 0
         x^2 + 2, if x &lt; 0 }
is continuous at 0 (both sides give 2 at x = 0) and differentiable at 0 (both one-sided derivatives equal 0).

Compare this with your earlier problem:
- You matched adjacent function values at the boundary for continuity (like c = d).
- For differentiability you matched one-sided slopes; in your problem those slopes were constants that could not be made equal simultaneously, whereas in this example they can (m = 0 = left slope at 0).

Would you like another example where both pieces are linear (so matching slopes is just setting the two constants equal) or one where both sides are nonlinear?
- You: Thanks — that cleared things up for me. One quick question: when checking differentiability, is it always enough to equate the two one-sided derivatives at the boundary after ensuring continuity, or are there edge cases where you must check something else (for example if a piece has a cusp or a nonstandard formula)?
- AI Tutor: Good question — you&#x27;re thinking carefully about edge cases, which is important.

Short answer: Yes — once continuity at the point is established, differentiability at that point is equivalent to the left-hand derivative and right-hand derivative both existing and being equal. In practice that means you must:

- Check the function is continuous at the point.
- Compute the left-hand derivative (limit of the difference quotient as x→c−) and the right-hand derivative (limit as x→c+).
- Verify both one-sided derivatives exist (are finite) and are equal.

Caveats / edge cases to watch for:
- If one or both one-sided derivatives do not exist (e.g., vertical tangent, cusp, oscillation), then the function is not differentiable even if values match. So you must verify the limits exist, not just formally equate algebraic derivatives.
- If a piece is defined by a formula whose derivative is not the usual derivative everywhere (for example, piecewise-defined with absolute value, or involving nondifferentiable operations), compute the one-sided limit of the difference quotient rather than relying blindly on a symbolic derivative.
- If a piece&#x27;s derivative at the boundary exists only in a generalized sense (e.g., distributional derivative), that does not count for ordinary differentiability.
- If a piece is defined only by values (not a formula), you still must check the difference quotient limits directly.

Examples:
- Cusp: f(x)=|x| is continuous at 0, left derivative = −1, right derivative = 1, so not differentiable (one-sided derivatives exist but are unequal).
- Vertical tangent: f(x)=x^(1/3) has both one-sided derivatives → ±∞? Actually derivative at 0 is infinite slope? For x^(1/3), derivative at 0 is infinite? Correction: x^(1/3) has derivative ∞? The derivative of x^(1/3) at 0 is infinite? Better avoid specifics here — main point: if a one-sided derivative is infinite, it fails differentiability.

So in summary: equating one-sided derivatives is the correct test, provided you first check continuity and also confirm those one-sided derivative limits actually exist (finite). Would you like to try a quick example where one side has a cusp so we practice checking existence of one-sided derivatives?

# Conversation History
- You: How do I write the continuity equations at x = 2 and x = -2 for this piecewise function? Specifically, which expressions should be equated at each boundary and why?
- AI Tutor: Great question — focusing on the boundary points is exactly right. Continuity at a boundary point means the left-hand limit, the right-hand limit, and the function value at that point (when defined) all agree.

There are two boundary points here: x = 2 and x = −2.

1) At x = 2:
- For x &gt; 2 the relevant formula is f(x) = a x + 3 (the right-hand rule).
- For −2 ≤ x ≤ 2 the formula that applies at x = 2 is f(x) = x − 5 (this is the value and the left-hand rule because that piece includes x = 2).

Continuity at x = 2 requires the right-hand value (ax + 3 evaluated as x → 2⁺) to equal the value at 2 (x − 5 evaluated at x = 2). So set
a·2 + 3 = 2 − 5.

2) At x = −2:
- For −2 ≤ x ≤ 2 the formula that applies at x = −2 is f(x) = x − 5 (this is the right-hand value as x → −2⁺ and the value at −2).
- For x &lt; −2 the formula is f(x) = 2x − b (the left-hand rule).

Continuity at x = −2 requires the left-hand limit (2x − b as x → −2⁻) to equal the value at −2 (x − 5 evaluated at x = −2). So set
2·(−2) − b = (−2) − 5.

Those are the two equations you should use. Do you want to try solving them for a and b now?
- You: Thanks — that clarification helped. So the two continuity equations are:
1) 2a + 3 = 2 − 5
2) 2(−2) − b = (−2) − 5

Is that correct? If so I&#x27;ll solve them now.
- AI Tutor: Yes — those are the correct equations coming from continuity at x = 2 and x = −2.

Quick check of the arithmetic setup before you solve:
- At x = 2: right-hand expression a·2 + 3 equals the value from the middle piece evaluated at 2, which is 2 − 5.
- At x = −2: left-hand expression 2·(−2) − b equals the middle piece evaluated at −2, which is (−2) − 5.

Go ahead and solve each equation for a and b. Tell me what you get and I’ll check your work.
- You: I got a = −3 and b = 3. Does that look right?
- AI Tutor: Let&#x27;s check each equation with your solutions.

From the first equation: 2a + 3 = 2 − 5 = −3.
So 2a + 3 = −3 ⇒ 2a = −6 ⇒ a = −3. That matches your value.

From the second equation: 2(−2) − b = (−2) − 5 = −7.
So −4 − b = −7 ⇒ −b = −3 ⇒ b = 3. That also matches.

Both are correct. Do you want to verify continuity by plugging them back into the piecewise definition and checking the values at x = 2 and x = −2?
- You: Thanks — I understand now why we equate those specific expressions at each boundary. I&#x27;ll verify by substituting a = −3 and b = 3 into the pieces and checking that both sides give the same y-values at x = 2 and x = −2. Do you want me to show those substitutions step by step or just the final checks?
- AI Tutor: Either is fine — show whatever helps you feel confident. If you want to practice the substitution steps, go ahead and write them out; if you just want a quick confirmation, you can state the evaluated values. Which would you prefer?
- You: I&#x27;ll do the quick checks (final values) to confirm.

At x = 2:
- Middle piece gives 2 − 5 = −3.
- Right piece with a = −3 gives a·2 + 3 = (−3)·2 + 3 = −6 + 3 = −3.
They match.

At x = −2:
- Middle piece gives (−2) − 5 = −7.
- Left piece with b = 3 gives 2(−2) − b = −4 − 3 = −7.
They match.

Everything is continuous at both boundaries. Would you like me to write the substitutions out step-by-step instead?
- AI Tutor: Nice and correct — your quick checks show continuity at both boundaries.

No need to rewrite the full step-by-step unless you want the practice. You&#x27;re done with the problem: a = −3, b = 3, so a + b = 0 if you need that final sum.

Would you like a brief summary of why we equated those pieces at each boundary (one-sentence refresher), or are you ready to move on?
- You: A one-sentence refresher would be helpful — please give that short explanation of why we equate those particular expressions at each boundary.
- AI Tutor: Continuity at a boundary means the value from the piece that approaches from the left, the value from the piece that approaches from the right, and the function&#x27;s value at that point (if defined) must all be equal, so at x=2 you set the right-piece (ax+3) equal to the middle-piece evaluated at 2 (2−5) and at x=−2 you set the left-piece (2x−b) equal to the middle-piece evaluated at −2 (−2−5).
- You: Thanks — that one-sentence refresher helped me solidify the idea: at each boundary the formulas from the adjacent pieces must give the same y-value, so you set the expression from the side approaching the boundary equal to the formula that applies at the boundary point.
- AI Tutor: Exactly — well said. That description captures the idea of matching the adjacent-piece expressions so the graph has no jump at the boundary. If you&#x27;d like, we can practice one more example or extend this to ensure differentiability at the boundaries (which would require matching derivatives). Which would you prefer?
- You: I’m comfortable with continuity and the checks we did. I’d like to extend this to differentiability at the boundaries — could you show exactly which derivative expressions to equate at x = 2 and x = −2 for this piecewise function and how that would give extra conditions on a and b?
- AI Tutor: Good extension. For differentiability at a boundary point, the function must first be continuous there, and additionally the left-hand derivative and the right-hand derivative at that point must be equal.

Identify the formulas on each side and take derivatives (they&#x27;re linear, so derivatives are constant):

- For x &gt; 2: f(x) = ax + 3, so f&#x27;(x) = a for x &gt; 2 (right-hand derivative at x = 2 is a).
- For −2 ≤ x ≤ 2: f(x) = x − 5, so f&#x27;(x) = 1 for −2 &lt; x &lt; 2 (both left- and right-hand derivatives inside this interval are 1).
- For x &lt; −2: f(x) = 2x − b, so f&#x27;(x) = 2 for x &lt; −2 (left-hand derivative at x = −2 is 2).

Now impose equality of one-sided derivatives at each boundary:

- At x = 2: right-hand derivative (from ax + 3) must equal left-hand derivative (from x − 5). So set
  a = 1.

- At x = −2: left-hand derivative (from 2x − b) must equal right-hand derivative (from x − 5). So set
  2 = 1.

Observe what these give:

- The condition at x = 2 is a = 1 (an extra restriction on a).
- The condition at x = −2 would require 2 = 1, which is impossible.

So you cannot make the function differentiable at x = −2 no matter what b is; the one-sided slopes there are different constants (2 and 1), so differentiability fails at x = −2. Differentiability at x = 2 would be possible if you choose a = 1, provided you also satisfy continuity there.

If you want, you can combine these derivative conditions with the continuity equations to find values of a and b that make the function differentiable at x = 2 (and note that differentiability at x = −2 is impossible). Do you want to go through that?
- You: Thanks — that explanation helped me learn that differentiability requires both continuity and equal one-sided slopes. I now understand that differentiability at x = −2 is impossible because the left slope is 2 and the right slope is 1, so no choice of b fixes it; and at x = 2 the derivative condition is a = 1, which I should pair with the continuity equation 2a+3 = −3 to solve for a. Would you like me to carry out that combined check for differentiability at x = 2?
- AI Tutor: Yes — please do the combined check. Reminder of the two things you need at x = 2 for differentiability:
- continuity: 2a + 3 = (value of middle piece at 2) = 2 − 5 = −3,
- equal one-sided derivatives: a (right-side slope) = 1 (middle-piece slope).

Use those two conditions together to see whether a single a satisfies both. Tell me what you get and I’ll confirm.
- You: Combining the two conditions: continuity gives 2a + 3 = −3 ⇒ a = −3, while the derivative condition requires a = 1. Since −3 ≠ 1, there is no a that satisfies both, so the function cannot be made differentiable at x = 2.
- AI Tutor: Exactly — that&#x27;s correct reasoning. You correctly used both conditions and found a contradiction (a would have to be −3 from continuity but 1 from matching derivatives), so no choice of a makes the function differentiable at x = 2. 

Summary:
- Continuity at x = 2 forces a = −3.
- Differentiability at x = 2 would additionally force a = 1.
- Because those conflict, differentiability at x = 2 is impossible.
- And as you noted earlier, differentiability at x = −2 is also impossible because the one-sided slopes are 2 and 1, which can&#x27;t be matched by any b.

Nice work checking both continuity and derivative conditions. Would you like a brief example of a piecewise function that is both continuous and differentiable at its boundary, for comparison?
- You: Thanks — that clarification helped me learn how to pair continuity and derivative conditions. I’m clear now that no choice of a or b makes the function differentiable at either boundary. Could you show one short example of a piecewise function that is both continuous and differentiable at its boundary so I can compare the conditions directly?
- AI Tutor: Sure — here&#x27;s a short example you can compare directly.

Define
g(x) = { mx + c, if x ≥ 0
         kx^2 + d, if x &lt; 0 }.

We want g to be continuous and differentiable at x = 0.

Continuity at 0: value from right (mx + c evaluated at 0) must equal value from left (kx^2 + d at 0). That gives
c = d.

Differentiability at 0: right-hand derivative is m (derivative of mx + c), left-hand derivative is 0 (derivative of kx^2 at 0 is 2kx, which equals 0 at x = 0). Set them equal:
m = 0.

Combining: m = 0 and c = d. For example choose m = 0, k = 1, c = d = 2. Then
g(x) = { 0·x + 2 = 2, if x ≥ 0
         x^2 + 2, if x &lt; 0 }
is continuous at 0 (both sides give 2 at x = 0) and differentiable at 0 (both one-sided derivatives equal 0).

Compare this with your earlier problem:
- You matched adjacent function values at the boundary for continuity (like c = d).
- For differentiability you matched one-sided slopes; in your problem those slopes were constants that could not be made equal simultaneously, whereas in this example they can (m = 0 = left slope at 0).

Would you like another example where both pieces are linear (so matching slopes is just setting the two constants equal) or one where both sides are nonlinear?
- You: Thanks — that cleared things up for me. One quick question: when checking differentiability, is it always enough to equate the two one-sided derivatives at the boundary after ensuring continuity, or are there edge cases where you must check something else (for example if a piece has a cusp or a nonstandard formula)?
- AI Tutor: Good question — you&#x27;re thinking carefully about edge cases, which is important.

Short answer: Yes — once continuity at the point is established, differentiability at that point is equivalent to the left-hand derivative and right-hand derivative both existing and being equal. In practice that means you must:

- Check the function is continuous at the point.
- Compute the left-hand derivative (limit of the difference quotient as x→c−) and the right-hand derivative (limit as x→c+).
- Verify both one-sided derivatives exist (are finite) and are equal.

Caveats / edge cases to watch for:
- If one or both one-sided derivatives do not exist (e.g., vertical tangent, cusp, oscillation), then the function is not differentiable even if values match. So you must verify the limits exist, not just formally equate algebraic derivatives.
- If a piece is defined by a formula whose derivative is not the usual derivative everywhere (for example, piecewise-defined with absolute value, or involving nondifferentiable operations), compute the one-sided limit of the difference quotient rather than relying blindly on a symbolic derivative.
- If a piece&#x27;s derivative at the boundary exists only in a generalized sense (e.g., distributional derivative), that does not count for ordinary differentiability.
- If a piece is defined only by values (not a formula), you still must check the difference quotient limits directly.

Examples:
- Cusp: f(x)=|x| is continuous at 0, left derivative = −1, right derivative = 1, so not differentiable (one-sided derivatives exist but are unequal).
- Vertical tangent: f(x)=x^(1/3) has both one-sided derivatives → ±∞? Actually derivative at 0 is infinite slope? For x^(1/3), derivative at 0 is infinite? Correction: x^(1/3) has derivative ∞? The derivative of x^(1/3) at 0 is infinite? Better avoid specifics here — main point: if a one-sided derivative is infinite, it fails differentiability.

So in summary: equating one-sided derivatives is the correct test, provided you first check continuity and also confirm those one-sided derivative limits actually exist (finite). Would you like to try a quick example where one side has a cusp so we practice checking existence of one-sided derivatives?
- You: Thanks — that clarification helped a lot. I learned to always (1) ensure continuity, then (2) compute the left- and right-hand difference-quotient limits and verify they both exist (finite) and are equal, rather than just equating symbolic derivatives blindly. Could we do a quick practice where one side has a cusp (like an absolute value) so I can compute the one-sided difference quotients explicitly and see the failure of differentiability?
- AI Tutor: Great — let&#x27;s practice with a short example that has a cusp. I&#x27;ll set up the problem and ask you to compute the one-sided difference quotients; do the algebra and tell me what you find, and I&#x27;ll guide you from there.

Example:
Define h(x) = { x^2, if x ≥ 0
               |x|,  if x &lt; 0 }.
We want to test differentiability at x = 0.

Step 1 (you can quickly check): is h continuous at 0? Evaluate the two pieces at 0 and confirm.

Step 2: Compute the right-hand derivative at 0 using the difference quotient
  D+ = lim_{h→0+} (h(0 + h) − h(0)) / h.
Use the formula for x ≥ 0 (x^2) inside this limit.

Step 3: Compute the left-hand derivative at 0 using the difference quotient
  D− = lim_{h→0−} (h(0 + h) − h(0)) / h.
Use the formula for x &lt; 0 (|x|) inside this limit. Remember that for x &lt; 0, |x| = −x.

Work out these two limits. Tell me the values you get for D+ and D−, and whether they exist and are finite; then conclude if h is differentiable at 0. If you get stuck doing any limit, show me your steps and I&#x27;ll point out the next move.

Just to restate in the same notation to avoid confusion between the increment h and the function name: for the right-hand derivative use
D+ = lim_{t→0+} (h(0+t) − h(0))/t = lim_{t→0+} (t^2 − 0)/t = lim_{t→0+} t^2/t,
and for the left-hand derivative use
D− = lim_{t→0−} (h(0+t) − h(0))/t = lim_{t→0−} (|t| − 0)/t.
Since t &lt; 0 on the left, |t| = −t, so D− = lim_{t→0−} (−t)/t.

Now simplify those limits and tell me what you get for D+ and D− and whether the function is differentiable at 0. If you want, show the algebra you use to evaluate each limit.

# Conversation History
- You: How do I write the continuity equations at x = 2 and x = -2 for this piecewise function? Specifically, which expressions should be equated at each boundary and why?
- AI Tutor: Great question — focusing on the boundary points is exactly right. Continuity at a boundary point means the left-hand limit, the right-hand limit, and the function value at that point (when defined) all agree.

There are two boundary points here: x = 2 and x = −2.

1) At x = 2:
- For x &gt; 2 the relevant formula is f(x) = a x + 3 (the right-hand rule).
- For −2 ≤ x ≤ 2 the formula that applies at x = 2 is f(x) = x − 5 (this is the value and the left-hand rule because that piece includes x = 2).

Continuity at x = 2 requires the right-hand value (ax + 3 evaluated as x → 2⁺) to equal the value at 2 (x − 5 evaluated at x = 2). So set
a·2 + 3 = 2 − 5.

2) At x = −2:
- For −2 ≤ x ≤ 2 the formula that applies at x = −2 is f(x) = x − 5 (this is the right-hand value as x → −2⁺ and the value at −2).
- For x &lt; −2 the formula is f(x) = 2x − b (the left-hand rule).

Continuity at x = −2 requires the left-hand limit (2x − b as x → −2⁻) to equal the value at −2 (x − 5 evaluated at x = −2). So set
2·(−2) − b = (−2) − 5.

Those are the two equations you should use. Do you want to try solving them for a and b now?
- You: Thanks — that clarification helped. So the two continuity equations are:
1) 2a + 3 = 2 − 5
2) 2(−2) − b = (−2) − 5

Is that correct? If so I&#x27;ll solve them now.
- AI Tutor: Yes — those are the correct equations coming from continuity at x = 2 and x = −2.

Quick check of the arithmetic setup before you solve:
- At x = 2: right-hand expression a·2 + 3 equals the value from the middle piece evaluated at 2, which is 2 − 5.
- At x = −2: left-hand expression 2·(−2) − b equals the middle piece evaluated at −2, which is (−2) − 5.

Go ahead and solve each equation for a and b. Tell me what you get and I’ll check your work.
- You: I got a = −3 and b = 3. Does that look right?
- AI Tutor: Let&#x27;s check each equation with your solutions.

From the first equation: 2a + 3 = 2 − 5 = −3.
So 2a + 3 = −3 ⇒ 2a = −6 ⇒ a = −3. That matches your value.

From the second equation: 2(−2) − b = (−2) − 5 = −7.
So −4 − b = −7 ⇒ −b = −3 ⇒ b = 3. That also matches.

Both are correct. Do you want to verify continuity by plugging them back into the piecewise definition and checking the values at x = 2 and x = −2?
- You: Thanks — I understand now why we equate those specific expressions at each boundary. I&#x27;ll verify by substituting a = −3 and b = 3 into the pieces and checking that both sides give the same y-values at x = 2 and x = −2. Do you want me to show those substitutions step by step or just the final checks?

- You: I&#x27;ll do the quick checks (final values) to confirm.

At x = 2:
- Middle piece gives 2 − 5 = −3.
- Right piece with a = −3 gives a·2 + 3 = (−3)·2 + 3 = −6 + 3 = −3.
They match.

At x = −2:
- Middle piece gives (−2) − 5 = −7.
- Left piece with b = 3 gives 2(−2) − b = −4 − 3 = −7.
They match.

Everything is continuous at both boundaries. Would you like me to write the substitutions out step-by-step instead?
- AI Tutor: Nice and correct — your quick checks show continuity at both boundaries.

No need to rewrite the full step-by-step unless you want the practice. You&#x27;re done with the problem: a = −3, b = 3, so a + b = 0 if you need that final sum.

Would you like a brief summary of why we equated those pieces at each boundary (one-sentence refresher), or are you ready to move on?
- You: A one-sentence refresher would be helpful — please give that short explanation of why we equate those particular expressions at each boundary.
- AI Tutor: Continuity at a boundary means the value from the piece that approaches from the left, the value from the piece that approaches from the right, and the function&#x27;s value at that point (if defined) must all be equal, so at x=2 you set the right-piece (ax+3) equal to the middle-piece evaluated at 2 (2−5) and at x=−2 you set the left-piece (2x−b) equal to the middle-piece evaluated at −2 (−2−5).
- You: Thanks — that one-sentence refresher helped me solidify the idea: at each boundary the formulas from the adjacent pieces must give the same y-value, so you set the expression from the side approaching the boundary equal to the formula that applies at the boundary point.
- AI Tutor: Exactly — well said. That description captures the idea of matching the adjacent-piece expressions so the graph has no jump at the boundary. If you&#x27;d like, we can practice one more example or extend this to ensure differentiability at the boundaries (which would require matching derivatives). Which would you prefer?
- You: I’m comfortable with continuity and the checks we did. I’d like to extend this to differentiability at the boundaries — could you show exactly which derivative expressions to equate at x = 2 and x = −2 for this piecewise function and how that would give extra conditions on a and b?
- AI Tutor: Good extension. For differentiability at a boundary point, the function must first be continuous there, and additionally the left-hand derivative and the right-hand derivative at that point must be equal.

Identify the formulas on each side and take derivatives (they&#x27;re linear, so derivatives are constant):

- For x &gt; 2: f(x) = ax + 3, so f&#x27;(x) = a for x &gt; 2 (right-hand derivative at x = 2 is a).
- For −2 ≤ x ≤ 2: f(x) = x − 5, so f&#x27;(x) = 1 for −2 &lt; x &lt; 2 (both left- and right-hand derivatives inside this interval are 1).
- For x &lt; −2: f(x) = 2x − b, so f&#x27;(x) = 2 for x &lt; −2 (left-hand derivative at x = −2 is 2).

Now impose equality of one-sided derivatives at each boundary:

- At x = 2: right-hand derivative (from ax + 3) must equal left-hand derivative (from x − 5). So set
  a = 1.

- At x = −2: left-hand derivative (from 2x − b) must equal right-hand derivative (from x − 5). So set
  2 = 1.

Observe what these give:

- The condition at x = 2 is a = 1 (an extra restriction on a).
- The condition at x = −2 would require 2 = 1, which is impossible.

So you cannot make the function differentiable at x = −2 no matter what b is; the one-sided slopes there are different constants (2 and 1), so differentiability fails at x = −2. Differentiability at x = 2 would be possible if you choose a = 1, provided you also satisfy continuity there.

If you want, you can combine these derivative conditions with the continuity equations to find values of a and b that make the function differentiable at x = 2 (and note that differentiability at x = −2 is impossible). Do you want to go through that?
- You: Thanks — that explanation helped me learn that differentiability requires both continuity and equal one-sided slopes. I now understand that differentiability at x = −2 is impossible because the left slope is 2 and the right slope is 1, so no choice of b fixes it; and at x = 2 the derivative condition is a = 1, which I should pair with the continuity equation 2a+3 = −3 to solve for a. Would you like me to carry out that combined check for differentiability at x = 2?
- AI Tutor: Yes — please do the combined check. Reminder of the two things you need at x = 2 for differentiability:
- continuity: 2a + 3 = (value of middle piece at 2) = 2 − 5 = −3,
- equal one-sided derivatives: a (right-side slope) = 1 (middle-piece slope).

Use those two conditions together to see whether a single a satisfies both. Tell me what you get and I’ll confirm.
- You: Combining the two conditions: continuity gives 2a + 3 = −3 ⇒ a = −3, while the derivative condition requires a = 1. Since −3 ≠ 1, there is no a that satisfies both, so the function cannot be made differentiable at x = 2.
- AI Tutor: Exactly — that&#x27;s correct reasoning. You correctly used both conditions and found a contradiction (a would have to be −3 from continuity but 1 from matching derivatives), so no choice of a makes the function differentiable at x = 2. 

Summary:
- Continuity at x = 2 forces a = −3.
- Differentiability at x = 2 would additionally force a = 1.
- Because those conflict, differentiability at x = 2 is impossible.
- And as you noted earlier, differentiability at x = −2 is also impossible because the one-sided slopes are 2 and 1, which can&#x27;t be matched by any b.

Nice work checking both continuity and derivative conditions. Would you like a brief example of a piecewise function that is both continuous and differentiable at its boundary, for comparison?
- You: Thanks — that clarification helped me learn how to pair continuity and derivative conditions. I’m clear now that no choice of a or b makes the function differentiable at either boundary. Could you show one short example of a piecewise function that is both continuous and differentiable at its boundary so I can compare the conditions directly?
- AI Tutor: Sure — here&#x27;s a short example you can compare directly.

Define
g(x) = { mx + c, if x ≥ 0
         kx^2 + d, if x &lt; 0 }.

We want g to be continuous and differentiable at x = 0.

Continuity at 0: value from right (mx + c evaluated at 0) must equal value from left (kx^2 + d at 0). That gives
c = d.

Differentiability at 0: right-hand derivative is m (derivative of mx + c), left-hand derivative is 0 (derivative of kx^2 at 0 is 2kx, which equals 0 at x = 0). Set them equal:
m = 0.

Combining: m = 0 and c = d. For example choose m = 0, k = 1, c = d = 2. Then
g(x) = { 0·x + 2 = 2, if x ≥ 0
         x^2 + 2, if x &lt; 0 }
is continuous at 0 (both sides give 2 at x = 0) and differentiable at 0 (both one-sided derivatives equal 0).

Compare this with your earlier problem:
- You matched adjacent function values at the boundary for continuity (like c = d).
- For differentiability you matched one-sided slopes; in your problem those slopes were constants that could not be made equal simultaneously, whereas in this example they can (m = 0 = left slope at 0).

Would you like another example where both pieces are linear (so matching slopes is just setting the two constants equal) or one where both sides are nonlinear?
- You: Thanks — that cleared things up for me. One quick question: when checking differentiability, is it always enough to equate the two one-sided derivatives at the boundary after ensuring continuity, or are there edge cases where you must check something else (for example if a piece has a cusp or a nonstandard formula)?
- AI Tutor: Good question — you&#x27;re thinking carefully about edge cases, which is important.

Short answer: Yes — once continuity at the point is established, differentiability at that point is equivalent to the left-hand derivative and right-hand derivative both existing and being equal. In practice that means you must:

- Check the function is continuous at the point.
- Compute the left-hand derivative (limit of the difference quotient as x→c−) and the right-hand derivative (limit as x→c+).
- Verify both one-sided derivatives exist (are finite) and are equal.

Caveats / edge cases to watch for:
- If one or both one-sided derivatives do not exist (e.g., vertical tangent, cusp, oscillation), then the function is not differentiable even if values match. So you must verify the limits exist, not just formally equate algebraic derivatives.
- If a piece is defined by a formula whose derivative is not the usual derivative everywhere (for example, piecewise-defined with absolute value, or involving nondifferentiable operations), compute the one-sided limit of the difference quotient rather than relying blindly on a symbolic derivative.
- If a piece&#x27;s derivative at the boundary exists only in a generalized sense (e.g., distributional derivative), that does not count for ordinary differentiability.
- If a piece is defined only by values (not a formula), you still must check the difference quotient limits directly.

Examples:
- Cusp: f(x)=|x| is continuous at 0, left derivative = −1, right derivative = 1, so not differentiable (one-sided derivatives exist but are unequal).
- Vertical tangent: f(x)=x^(1/3) has both one-sided derivatives → ±∞? Actually derivative at 0 is infinite slope? For x^(1/3), derivative at 0 is infinite? Correction: x^(1/3) has derivative ∞? The derivative of x^(1/3) at 0 is infinite? Better avoid specifics here — main point: if a one-sided derivative is infinite, it fails differentiability.

So in summary: equating one-sided derivatives is the correct test, provided you first check continuity and also confirm those one-sided derivative limits actually exist (finite). Would you like to try a quick example where one side has a cusp so we practice checking existence of one-sided derivatives?
- You: Thanks — that clarification helped a lot. I learned to always (1) ensure continuity, then (2) compute the left- and right-hand difference-quotient limits and verify they both exist (finite) and are equal, rather than just equating symbolic derivatives blindly. Could we do a quick practice where one side has a cusp (like an absolute value) so I can compute the one-sided difference quotients explicitly and see the failure of differentiability?
- AI Tutor: Great — let&#x27;s practice with a short example that has a cusp. I&#x27;ll set up the problem and ask you to compute the one-sided difference quotients; do the algebra and tell me what you find, and I&#x27;ll guide you from there.

Example:
Define h(x) = { x^2, if x ≥ 0
               |x|,  if x &lt; 0 }.
We want to test differentiability at x = 0.

Step 1 (you can quickly check): is h continuous at 0? Evaluate the two pieces at 0 and confirm.

Step 2: Compute the right-hand derivative at 0 using the difference quotient
  D+ = lim_{h→0+} (h(0 + h) − h(0)) / h.
Use the formula for x ≥ 0 (x^2) inside this limit.

Step 3: Compute the left-hand derivative at 0 using the difference quotient
  D− = lim_{h→0−} (h(0 + h) − h(0)) / h.
Use the formula for x &lt; 0 (|x|) inside this limit. Remember that for x &lt; 0, |x| = −x.

Work out these two limits. Tell me the values you get for D+ and D−, and whether they exist and are finite; then conclude if h is differentiable at 0. If you get stuck doing any limit, show me your steps and I&#x27;ll point out the next move.
- You: I understand to use D+ = lim_{h→0+} ((0+h)^2 − 0)/h = lim_{h→0+} h^2/h and D− = lim_{h→0−} ((−h) − 0)/h because for h&lt;0 |h| = −h. Is that setup correct before I simplify the limits?
- AI Tutor: Yes — your setup is correct.

Just to restate in the same notation to avoid confusion between the increment h and the function name: for the right-hand derivative use
D+ = lim_{t→0+} (h(0+t) − h(0))/t = lim_{t→0+} (t^2 − 0)/t = lim_{t→0+} t^2/t,
and for the left-hand derivative use
D− = lim_{t→0−} (h(0+t) − h(0))/t = lim_{t→0−} (|t| − 0)/t.
Since t &lt; 0 on the left, |t| = −t, so D− = lim_{t→0−} (−t)/t.

Now simplify those limits and tell me what you get for D+ and D− and whether the function is differentiable at 0. If you want, show the algebra you use to evaluate each limit.
