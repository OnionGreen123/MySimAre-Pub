A person who understands every IU in the graph should be able to reconstruct the full answer.\n3. **Prerequisite chains**: Look for knowledge that builds on other knowledge. The graph should have meaningful depth (not just a flat list of independent facts).\n4. **Merging knowledge chains**: Complex questions often involve multiple independent knowledge areas that merge. Identify where separate chains of understanding converge.\n5. **Target**: Aim for 10-30 IUs depending on question complexity. Simple questions may have 10-15, complex questions may have 20-30.\n\n## Input\n\nQuestion: Let \\\\[f(x) = \\\\left\\\\{\n\\\\begin{array}{cl} ax+3, &\\\\text{ if }x>2, \\\\\\\\\nx-5 &\\\\text{ if } -2 \\\\le x \\\\le 2, \\\\\\\\\n2x-b &\\\\text{ if } x <-2.\n\\\\end{array}\n\\\\right.\\\\]Find $a+b$ if the piecewise function is continuous (which means that its graph can be drawn without lifting your pencil from the paper).\n\nReference Answer: For the piecewise function to be continuous, the cases must \"meet\" at $2$ and $-2$. For example, $ax+3$ and $x-5$ must be equal when $x=2$. This implies $a(2)+3=2-5$, which we solve to get $2a=-6 \\\\Rightarrow a=-3$. Similarly, $x-5$ and $2x-b$ must be equal when $x=-2$.
